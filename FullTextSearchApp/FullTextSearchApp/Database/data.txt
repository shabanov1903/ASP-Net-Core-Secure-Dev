1	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administrationтАЩs authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. TrumpтАЩs administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. тАЬGiven that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,тАЭ said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. тАЬUpon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. тАЭ In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge CollyerтАЩs decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they тАЬand the  тАЩs transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  тАЩs inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. тАЭ The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will тАЬprovide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. тАЭ Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of тАЬcascading effectsтАЭ if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  тАЩs dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case тАЬwill produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nationтАЩs health insurance and health care systems generally. тАЭ No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  тАФ   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  тАФ   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  тАФ   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.
2	After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the cityтАЩs efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the cityтАЩs 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the cityтАЩs five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The boroughтАЩs robbery squad is smaller than ManhattanтАЩs, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunmanтАЩs crew than confident in the Police DepartmentтАЩs ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the callerтАЩs arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. тАЬHere, we have nothing,тАЭ she said. When it comes to тАЬ  families,тАЭ she said, the authorities тАЬdonтАЩt really care as much. ThatтАЩs how I feel. тАЭ The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  тАФ   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  тАФ   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officersтАЩ view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. DetectivesтАЩ phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victimтАЩs friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a motherтАЩs apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crewsтАЩ threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. MaryтАЩs Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. тАЬThereтАЩs a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,тАЭ a sergeantтАЩs police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, тАЬIтАЩm going to shoot through your window. тАЭ Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagersтАЩ names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, тАЬthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,тАЭ Mr. FernandezтАЩs wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to тАЬslapтАЭ her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because тАЬthey are the ones snitching,тАЭ her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinctтАЩs residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  тАФ   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  тАФ   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the cityтАЩs   campaign. тАЬI havenтАЩt got one single phone call thatтАЩs putting me in the right direction here,тАЭ said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinctтАЩs detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victimтАЩs aunt about why the killer had not been caught. тАЬAnd people just donтАЩt understand that. тАЭ Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third  тАФ   66 victims  тАФ   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. тАЬI need to bring something in today to justify my existence,тАЭ Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. тАЬSo now youтАЩre in a small area, and day after day youтАЩre hammering the same community. Of course that communityтАЩs eventually going to turn on you. тАЭ The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. тАЬSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,тАЭ said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. тАЬNot because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you canтАЩt give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. тАЭ Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be тАЬticket fixing,тАЭ or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. тАЬWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,тАЭ said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. тАЬIt was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didnтАЩt want to get caught up in anything. тАЭ The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  тАФ   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. OтАЩNeill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. OтАЩNeill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to peopleтАЩs concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. тАЬThat perception really sticks,тАЭ he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinctтАЩs 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    тАФ   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the DetectivesтАЩ Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the departmentтАЩs efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: тАЬIf I cooperate with the detectives, thereтАЩs so much work, thereтАЩs so few of them there, they wonтАЩt even get the chance to protect me, or theyтАЩll be there too late when the retaliation comes. тАЭ Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. тАЬWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,тАЭ he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The TimesтАЩs analysis of confidential staffing data, the departmentтАЩs chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinctтАЩs detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the cityтАЩs last тАЬтАЭ the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. тАЬAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved,тАЭ said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. тАЬThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. тАЭ Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last yearтАЩs homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. тАЬItтАЩs the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,тАЭ said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part тАЬbecause thatтАЩs where the money is. тАЭ He added: тАЬWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then heтАЩs done the complete opposite of what he said. ItтАЩs just business as usual. тАЭ The BronxтАЩs struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass BrooklynтАЩs rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice OтАЩShaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District AttorneyтАЩs office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, тАЬI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they canтАЩt be impartial because they donтАЩt trust the police. тАЭ Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzoтАЩs detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered sonтАЩs ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th PrecinctтАЩs homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapistтАЩs help. VictimsтАЩ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would тАЬget what you deserve. тАЭ The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a womanтАЩs son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  тАФ   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  тАФ   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisorтАЩs permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. FernandezтАЩs daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victimтАЩs advocate in the district attorneyтАЩs office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissionerтАЩs office. тАЬWe went to all proper channels for help,тАЭ the note said. тАЬBoth precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. тАЭ тАЬ40th and PSA 7 wonтАЩt do anything,тАЭ he wrote, referring to the local substation. тАЬPlease we need to speak to some one with authority. тАЭ The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry OтАЩSullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a womanтАЩs apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. тАЬI have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,тАЭ Mr. Fernandez said. тАЬThe only thing I know for sure: God, if weтАЩre in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. тАЭ Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. тАЬIтАЩm bending over backward, and nobodyтАЩs not even doing anything,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhy am I going to help you, if you ainтАЩt going to help me?тАЭ By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector OтАЩSullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. тАЬNo one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,тАЭ he said. Mr. FernandezтАЩs complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away.
3	When Walt DisneyтАЩs тАЬBambiтАЭ opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the filmтАЩs striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to тАЬBambi,тАЭ which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the filmтАЩs title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  тАФ   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  тАФ   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them тАЬThe Sands of Iwo JimaтАЭ (1949) тАЬRebel Without a CauseтАЭ (1955) and тАЬThe Wild BunchтАЭ (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for тАЬBambiтАЭ that Mr. Wong was  тАФ   belatedly  тАФ   most renowned. тАЬHe was truly involved with every phase of production,тАЭ John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. тАЬHe created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. тАЭ In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of тАЬWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,тАЭ a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museumтАЩs windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  тАФ   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a тАЬpaper sonтАЭ  тАФ   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  тАФ   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, тАЬpaper sonsтАЭ posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. тАЬAngel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,тАЭ Lisa See, the author of тАЬOn Gold MountainтАЭ (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: тАЬThe goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. тАЭ Because Mr. WongтАЩs father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. тАЬI was scared half to death I just cried,тАЭ Mr. Wong recalled in тАЬTyrus,тАЭ an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. тАЬEvery day is just miserable  тАФ   miserable. I hated that place. тАЭ On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized тАЬTai YowтАЭ to тАЬTyrus,тАЭ and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  тАФ   possibly more  тАФ   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  тАФ   a small fortune  тАФ   to let him stay on as OtisтАЩs youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental ArtistsтАЩ Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of membersтАЩ work  тАФ   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an тАЬтАЭ creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  тАЩs job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  тАФ   тАЬa terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,тАЭ Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting тАЬBambi, a Life in the Woods,тАЭ the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film тАЬSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,тАЭ a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  тАФ   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  тАФ   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for тАЬBambi,тАЭ it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. тАЬI said, тАШGee, this is all outdoor scenery,тАЩтАЭ he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: тАЬI said, тАШGee, IтАЩm a landscape painter! тАЩтАЭ Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 тАФ  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  тАФ   at once lush and spare  тАФ   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. тАЬWalt Disney went crazy over them,тАЭ said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book тАЬBefore the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch ArtistsтАЭ (1996). тАЬHe said, тАШI love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. тАЩтАЭ Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. тАЬBut he was more than that,тАЭ Mr. Canemaker explained. тАЬHe was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. тАЭ Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of тАЬBambi. тАЭ Throughout the finished film  тАФ   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  тАФ   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employeesтАЩ strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  тАФ   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  тАФ   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On тАЬBambi,тАЭ Mr. WongтАЩs name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere тАЬbackgroundтАЭ artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  тАФ   and lent out on occasion to other studios  тАФ   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. тАЬThen in a month youтАЩd go back there and the sign was still there,тАЭ Mr. Wong recalled in тАЬTyrus. тАЭ After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental ArtistsтАЩ Group. Mr. WongтАЩs friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. тАЬIf World War II hadnтАЩt happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,тАЭ Ms. See said. тАЬAnd thatтАЩs because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. тАЭ Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  тАФ   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  тАФ   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth WongтАЩs life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on тАЬBambi,тАЭ Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  тАФ   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  тАФ   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family MuseumтАЩs retrospective, тАЬWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,тАЭ traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. WongтАЩs death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.
4	Death may be the great equalizer, but it isnтАЩt necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  тАФ   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  тАФ   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  тАФ   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  тАФ   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  тАФ   I hesitate to say merry  тАФ   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, тАЬUntil then, hereтАЩs another song. тАЭ It was as if 2016 hadnтАЩt delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people canтАЩt bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain manтАЩs mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to ElvisтАЩs swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golfтАЩs first media star. The gentlemanтАЩs game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  тАФ   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductorтАЩs son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  тАФ   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  тАФ   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated womenтАЩs basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat AlzheimerтАЩs disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League BaseballтАЩs first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy ReaganтАЩs death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John GlennтАЩs had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam WarтАЩs roiling home front. Phyllis SchlaflyтАЩs obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wingтАЩs ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Eli├бn Gonz├бlez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel CastroтАЩs death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  тАФ   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  тАФ   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the тАЬStar WarsтАЭ tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a motherтАЩs grief. Devotees of the тАЬHarry PotterтАЭ movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of SnapeтАЩs younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa GaborтАЩs celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the тАЬGodfatherтАЭ movies and тАЬBarney Miller,тАЭ actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some criticsтАЩ eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (тАЬAdventures of SupermanтАЭ) Alan Young (тАЬMister EdтАЭ) Robert Vaughn (тАЬThe Man From U. N. C. L. E. тАЭ) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on тАЬThe Patty Duke ShowтАЭ) Dan Haggerty (тАЬThe Life and Times of Grizzly AdamsтАЭ) Florence Henderson (тАЬThe Brady BunchтАЭ) and Alan Thicke (тАЬGrowing PainsтАЭ). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with тАЬHappy Days,тАЭ тАЬMork  Mindy,тАЭ тАЬLaverne  ShirleyтАЭ and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French workerтАЩs jacket with a camera slung around his neck  тАФ   what a picture!  тАФ   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. MusicтАЩs other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the тАЩ80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyoneтАЩs guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.
5	SEOUL, South Korea  тАФ   North KoreaтАЩs leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  тАФ   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New YearтАЩs Day speech, which was broadcast on the NorthтАЩs   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. тАЬWe have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,тАЭ he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. TrumpтАЩs new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. KimтАЩs professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. KimтАЩs speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. TrumpтАЩs inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. тАЬWe need to take note of the fact that this is the first New YearтАЩs speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,тАЭ he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. TrumpтАЩs election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the NorthтАЩs launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the NorthтАЩs satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  тАФ   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the EarthтАЩs atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North тАЬcan tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. тАЭ On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.
6	LONDON  тАФ   Queen Elizabeth II, who has been battling a cold for more than a week, missed a New YearтАЩs Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. A week earlier, the queen, who is 90, missed a Christmas Day church service, for the first time since 1988, because of the illness. тАЬThe Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,тАЭ the palace said in a statement. The queenтАЩs husband, Prince Philip, who had also been ill, was well enough to attend both services, in the church at Sandringham, which is in Norfolk, on the east coast of England. The queen, who ascended to the throne in 1952, became the worldтАЩs   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also BritainтАЩs   monarch, having last year surpassed Queen VictoriaтАЩs   reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.
7	BEIJING  тАФ   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized ChinaтАЩs leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. тАЬStep by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,тАЭ she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that S├гo Tom├й and Pr├нncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of TaiwanтАЩs fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite BeijingтАЩs recent actions, which she said had тАЬhurt the feelingsтАЭ of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. тАЬWe will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,тАЭ she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized ChinaтАЩs military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. TsaiтАЩs words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of ChinaтАЩs show of strength. тАЬShe remains calm, rational and patient,тАЭ Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. TsaiтАЩs preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. TrumpтАЩs bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to тАЬmaintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. тАЭ Ms. TsaiтАЩs vision, however, тАЬmay not align well with the incoming Trump administrationтАЩs apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,тАЭ he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as тАЬunofficial,тАЭ saying, тАЬA transit stop is just a transit stop. тАЭ
8	Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBCтАЩs reality television show тАЬThe Biggest Loser,тАЭ shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  тАФ   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. тАЬIтАЩve got my life back,тАЭ he declared. тАЬI mean, I feel like a million bucks. тАЭ Mr. Cahill left the showтАЩs stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that seasonтАЩs 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8тАЩs contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the тАЬBiggest LoserтАЭ contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. тАЬIt is frightening and amazing,тАЭ said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. тАЬI am just blown away. тАЭ It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  тАФ   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  тАФ   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that тАЬThe Biggest LoserтАЭ contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestantsтАЩ metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nationтАЩs obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is тАЬnew and important. тАЭ тАЬThe key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you canтАЩt get away from a basic biological reality,тАЭ said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. тАЬAs long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. тАЭ The showтАЩs doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestantsтАЩ metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. тАЬUnfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  тАФ   and thatтАЩs something we all need to work hard to change,тАЭ he said in an email. The studyтАЩs findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a personтАЩs body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  тАФ   it may be an effect of aging  тАФ   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston ChildrenтАЩs Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. тАЬThis is a subset of the most successfulтАЭ dieters, he said. тАЬIf they donтАЩt show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?тАЭ Still, he added, тАЬthat shouldnтАЩt be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. тАЭ Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. тАЬThere is a lot of basic research we still need to do,тАЭ said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. тАЬWhat people donтАЩt understand is that a treat is like a drug,тАЭ said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. тАЬTwo treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. тАЭ Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. тАЬAll my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,тАЭ Mr. Cahill said. тАЬThe moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, тАШThis is not right. Something is wrong with my body. тАЩтАЭ Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. тАЬItтАЩs kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,тАЭ he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the seasonтАЩs finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by AustraliaтАЩs National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. тАЬWhat was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,тАЭ Dr. Proietto said. тАЬThe body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. тАЭ Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. тАЬI used to look at myself and think, тАШI am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,тАЩтАЭ he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. тАЬI remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, тАШI should just run out in front of a car. тАЩтАЭ He eventually seized on тАЬThe Biggest LoserтАЭ as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the тАЬBiggest LoserтАЭ ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  тАФ   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  тАФ   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the showтАЩs finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. тАЬIтАЩd eat five bites. Then IтАЩd black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, тАШWhat did I do? тАЩтАЭ Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the bodyтАЩs systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. тАЬWe eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,тАЭ he said. тАЬThese very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  тАФ   less than one Starburst candy  тАФ   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. тАЭ тАЬIt is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,тАЭ Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. тАЬUnless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,тАЭ he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  тАФ     or   diets, for example  тАФ   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. тАЬThere are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,тАЭ he said, but he added that тАЬfor most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  тАФ   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. тАЭ Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. тАЬThe difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,тАЭ he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. HallтАЩs group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. тАЬThat shame that was on my shoulders went off,тАЭ he said.
9	Just how   is Hillary Kerr, the    founder of a   digital media company in Los Angeles? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was тАЬThese Days,тАЭ the version sung by Nico, the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually, the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy, now 38, on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr canтАЩt remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down тАЬlike Tigger,тАЭ as she put it. In answering the usual     questions, Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for тАЬGirls,тАЭ the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. тАЬYour music has changed my life!тАЭ she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy, who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesnтАЩt jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. тАЬMy main reaction,тАЭ he said, тАЬwas itтАЩs a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when youтАЩre working on a hit show. тАЭ They exchanged email addresses, more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives, but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy, who grew up in Laconia, N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on тАЬGirls. тАЭ The team has also worked on films including тАЬTrainwreckтАЭ and television series such as тАЬNew Girl. тАЭ In addition, Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for тАЬSurvivorтАЩs RemorseтАЭ on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego, graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York, where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast, to Los Angeles, and with a fellow Elle alum,  Katherine Power, created a company best known for its website, Who What Wear, which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr, Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long, boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. тАЬThere was banter,тАЭ Ms. Kerr said, but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later, she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider, the bandтАЩs lead singer, and had an extra ticket. тАЬThis was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are,тАЭ Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous тАЬmixtape era,тАЭ in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy тАЬare we just friends or whatтАЭ texts revolving around music. For example, Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for тАЬwalking around SoHo music. тАЭ He sent her a link to тАЬLove Me Again,тАЭ by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. тАЬI wanted to read into it,тАЭ Ms. Kerr said, but she figured (correctly, it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didnтАЩt spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of тАЬNeed Your Love So Bad. тАЭ After listening to it, Ms. Kerr said, тАЬI called my friend Katie. тАЭ тАЬAt that time,тАЭ she continued, тАЬI just referred to him as тАШthe supervisor.тАЩ She knew I had a crush on him. She said, тАШHow can it not mean something? тАЩтАЭ Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. тАЬI sort of thought, тАШMaybe itтАЩs too much. тАЩтАЭ But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song тАЬBedBedBedBedBed, Vacationer Remix,тАЭ by Deleted Scenes, тАЬduring the friend phase,тАЭ Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game, too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled тАЬFeynman Diagrams for All,тАЭ after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  тАФ   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  тАФ   was romantic. On the mix, Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song тАЬIтАЩve Been Let Down. тАЭ It was тАЬa bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings,тАЭ she said. Around this time, Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar,  the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song тАЬChristmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis,тАЭ which happens to be Mr. LeahyтАЩs favorite Tom Waits tune. тАЬThis made me rethink things a bit,тАЭ he said, adding, тАЬHillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. тАЭ In early 2014, Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The bandтАЩs lead singer is Jack Antonoff, who is Ms. DunhamтАЩs boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well, and on meeting Ms. Kerr, she said, тАЬIтАЩve heard so much about you. тАЭ Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, on Jan. 1, 2016. On Dec. 10, 125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs, Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel, which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress, strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played тАЬOnce, With Feeling,тАЭ an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception, a few of Ms. KerrтАЩs best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin, the celebrity hairstylist and social media star, started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the brideтАЩs hair. Joey Maalouf, the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App, whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the brideтАЩs pucker. He had done her makeup. тАЬThe look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect,тАЭ he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool, which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared, and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). тАЬThis looks like itтАЩs art directed,тАЭ Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram, said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match, based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray, the features and news director at InStyle, was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. тАЬHillary loves music, and itтАЩs not just a casual thing,тАЭ Ms. Ray said. тАЬWe used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director, and now sheтАЩs married to one. тАЭ After a romantic first dance to Solomon BurkeтАЩs тАЬIf You Need Me,тАЭ Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon, Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10, 2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel, Palm Springs, Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis, because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire, where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents, Richard and Marie Leahy, reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies, Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. LeahyтАЩs family is Roman Catholic Ms. KerrтАЩs parents, John and Carole Kerr, are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith, an executive coach, author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr, officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver, as well as a passage from the Supreme CourtтАЩs 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. тАЬA little Catholic priest, a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner, a little equal rights for all,тАЭ Ms. Kerr explained after the ceremony.
10	Angels are everywhere in the Mu├▒iz familyтАЩs apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As Jos├й and Zoraida Mu├▒iz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. ZoraidaтАЩs early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the childrenтАЩs father withdrew support. Then ZoraidaтАЩs grandfather  тАФ   the father of her absent father  тАФ   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met Jos├й, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. Mu├▒iz began having violent seizures  тАФ   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, Jos├й Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. ThatтАЩs where the angels came in  тАФ   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  тАЬWhen they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,тАЭ Ms. Mu├▒iz, 50, said. тАЬFrom there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. тАЭ All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Mu├▒izesтАЩ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Mu├▒iz. тАЬSo many people throw away things, so I donтАЩt have to buy,тАЭ she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. Mu├▒iz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Mu├▒iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. тАЬIтАЩm willing to take anything with him,тАЭ she said. тАЬI never left him alone, and I never will. тАЭ Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Mu├▒izтАЩs life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Mu├▒iz children grew up. тАЬWeтАЩve been through every craziness,тАЭ said Jos├й Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, тАЬevery up and down. тАЭ For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a   job at a ZaroтАЩs Bakery in ManhattanтАЩs financial district. Because the familyтАЩs rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for Jos├й Sr. тАЩs mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Mu├▒iz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York TimesтАЩs Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. Jos├й Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film AcademyтАЩs photography program. But Jos├й Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. тАЬThey give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,тАЭ she said. Jos├й Jr. agreed. тАЬI use my parents and siblings as my motivation,тАЭ he said. тАЬWeтАЩre all there for each other,тАЭ Ms. Mu├▒iz said.
11	With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December, after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. TrumpтАЩs victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up, up and away soared the offers  тАФ   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  тАФ   oil leases  тАФ   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States, with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. TrumpтАЩs appointees examine the facts, they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President ObamaтАЩs strong push to tackle global warming. Now, of course, everything is in flux. In the worst case, with a sufficiently pliant Congress, Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. TrumpтАЩs part, his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas, which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced, and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides, but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years, in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa. That state  тАФ     in presidential politics, let us remember  тАФ   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. тАЬSenator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry,тАЭ said Tom Kiernan, the head of the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his groupтАЩs calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. тАЬWe are creating jobs throughout America,   jobs, and we think   Trump will want that to continue,тАЭ he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock, he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates, a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight, some Republican senators would defect on principle, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. тАЬThatтАЩs a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together,тАЭ Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind, but for the United States as a whole, the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president, but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality.
12	THOMPSONS, Tex.  тАФ   Can one of the most promising  тАФ   and troubled  тАФ   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. TrumpтАЩs denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change, a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees, might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technologyтАЩs supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up, the plant, which is attached to one of the power company NRGтАЩs hulking   units, will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3, 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State. Still, it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  тАФ   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles, or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214, 338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plantтАЩs skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream, pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment, is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use, and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova, a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, will not just grab the CO2, it will use it, pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15, 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant, which has received $190 million from the federal government, can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel, said David Knox, an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January, Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: тАЬWeтАЩre not going to declare victory before itтАЩs time. тАЭ If the price of oil stabilizes or rises, and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop, he said, utilities might ask, тАЬwhy would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?тАЭ But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen, which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  тАФ   a problem known as тАЬparasitic load. тАЭ The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose, which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be, and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds, it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon captureтАЩs problems, its supporters, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency, call the technology, known as carbon capture sequestration, crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. тАЬIf you donтАЩt have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down, and the cost of success goes up,тАЭ said Julio Friedmann, an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. тАЬIf you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. тАЭ Carbon capture is proving itself, said David Mohler, the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said. тАЬYou cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  тАФ   you really have to do this stuff in the real world,тАЭ he said. Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. тАЬWe do figure things out as we go,тАЭ he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is, at this point, anyoneтАЩs guess. тАЬThe technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere,тАЭ said Mark Brownstein, a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. тАЬI actually think itтАЩs a moment of optimism,тАЭ said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. тАЬWhat I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs,тАЭ she said. тАЬI think he was intriguedтАЭ about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added. One of the pillars of Mr. TrumpтАЩs campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants, but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. тАЬThe decision they are making is not, what does the political outlook look like today? WhatтАЩs it look like over the life of this plant?тАЭ Although she concedes that a   revival of coalтАЩs fortunes is unlikely, carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nationтАЩs energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson, general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute, which promotes the technology, said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. тАЬI wouldnтАЩt say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,тАЭ he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes, or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant, in La Porte, Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam, eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants, the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means, in effect, that тАЬthe cost of being green is zero,тАЭ said Bill Brown, the chief executive of Net Power. тАЬThe potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer,тАЭ said Fatima Maria Ahmad, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation, a power company, the engineering and construction firm CBI, and 8 Rivers Capital, which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  тАФ   тАЬrapid unplanned disassemblyтАЭ  тАФ   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nationтАЩs carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress, consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe, where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. тАЬWe see this very much playing into all parts of the world,тАЭ said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CBIтАЩs technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture, said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for Sierra Club. тАЬThis is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,тАЭ he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that donтАЩt pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann, the former energy official, predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. тАЬItтАЩs convenient to just say тАШKeep it in the ground,тАЩ тАЭ he said, referring to an   slogan. тАЬWhat I prefer to say is тАШKeep it from the air. тАЩтАЭ
13	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  тАФ   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. TrumpтАЩs    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. TrumpтАЩs   private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th presidentтАЩs winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the propertyтАЩs original owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. TrumpтАЩs arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up   тАЩs membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. TrumpтАЩs victory in November,    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. тАЬItтАЩs like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,тАЭ said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in тАЬSunset BoulevardтАЭ or тАЬCitizen Kane,тАЭ two of Mr. TrumpтАЩs favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New YearтАЩs Eve party on Saturday night, a   white menu included тАЬMr. TrumpтАЩs wedge salad,тАЭ a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a тАЬbreakfast buffet. тАЭ Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. TrumpтАЩs two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBCтАЩs тАЬMorning JoeтАЭ were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. TrumpтАЩs business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. TrumpтАЩs aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. TrumpтАЩs combative public persona  тАФ   often on display during his campaign  тАФ   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. тАЬ   is an environment he can control,тАЭ said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. тАЬI watched him hold court  тАФ   he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed. тАЭ Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the   as тАЬseeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious. тАЭ Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him тАЬMr. Exxon. тАЭ) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is MexicoтАЩs richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their    son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (тАЬMy Way,тАЭ a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from тАЬFiddler on the Roof. тАЭ Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so  тАФ   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its ownerтАЩs coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important тАЬthat we keep Donald and his family safe. тАЭ Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around, and expect it will continue. тАЬThe loser in this game is Camp David,тАЭ said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. тАЬOnce youтАЩre at    and itтАЩs so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp DavidтАЩs Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. тАЭ
14	This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate lifeтАЩs opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. When you woke up this morning, what did you do first? Did you hop in the shower, check your email or grab a doughnut? What did you say to your roommates on the way out the door? Salad or hamburger for lunch? When you got home, did you put on your sneakers and go for a run, or eat dinner in front of the television? Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of   decision making, but theyтАЩre not. TheyтАЩre habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own, over time, the meals we eat, how we spend our evenings, and how often we exercise have enormous impacts. This is particularly true in our 20s, when so many of our habits are still up for grabs. The patterns you establish right now will impact your health, productivity, financial security and happiness for decades. How much money you make, how much time you spend with your friends and family, how well your body functions years from now  тАФ   all of these, in many ways, are products of the habits you are building today. (Related: The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s) And in the last decade, our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed. WeтАЩve learned how habits form  тАФ   and why they are so hard to break. We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before. At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: A cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  тАФ   such as exercise habits  тАФ   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. In 2002, researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals, most of whom worked out at least three times a week. They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim, or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However, the reason they continued exercising  тАФ   why it became a habit  тАФ   was because of a specific cue and a specific reward. If you want to start running each morning, itтАЩs essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day) and a clear reward (like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that, at first, the rewards inherent in exercise arenтАЩt enough. So to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward, you need to give yourself something you really enjoy  тАФ   like a small piece of chocolate  тАФ   after your workout. This is counterintuitive, because most people start exercising to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue (тАЬItтАЩs 5 oтАЩclockтАЭ) with a routine (тАЬThree miles down! тАЭ) and a reward (тАЬChocolate! тАЭ). Eventually, your brain will start expecting the reward inherent in exercise (тАЬItтАЩs 5 oтАЩclock. Three miles down! Endorphin rush! тАЭ) and you wonтАЩt need the chocolate anymore. In fact, you wonтАЩt even want it. But until your neurology learns to enjoy those endorphins and the other rewards inherent in exercise, you need to   the process. And then, over time, it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. You wonтАЩt want the chocolate anymore. YouтАЩll just crave the endorphins. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, will start triggering a craving for the inherent rewards to come. Want more? You might also like: тАв The scientific   workout тАв No time to workout?

15	ItтАЩs the season for family travel and photos  тАФ   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are, of course, the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish, print a photo on canvas, or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly, professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix, or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many   printing services, as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display, be it burlap, wood boards, acrylic or    fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that IтАЩd never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. IтАЩve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation, then with a   home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art, I was most interested in trying engineer prints, named for the large, lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, itтАЩs a particular aesthetic, one thatтАЩs most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press, which is run by Photojojo, an online photography gear shop, and Zoomin, a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites, you upload your image, zoom in closer if you like, and then click to buy. The siteтАЩs engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet, and cost $20 in black and white, and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: ItтАЩs clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal, glass, newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine, which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having тАЬa cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan. тАЭ A fabric print  тАФ   not soft like a bedsheet, more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  тАФ   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it, you can peel and stick it on your wall. The siteтАЩs fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54, from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99, a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  тАФ   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but youтАЩre printing on special material. Regardless of the cost, I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo  тАФ   crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge  тАФ   were nicely defined. SnapBox is a   site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters, it also offers fine art prints, photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic, printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos, which, thematically speaking, seems to make sense for certain subjects, like nature photos taken at, say, the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern, like a skyscraper or a tower, look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn, a family business that makes its products by hand in a тАЬ тАЭ in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas, which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick, and the image was crisp with a slight sheen  тАФ   a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive, though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didnтАЩt have a problem, but if time is of the essence, you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once youтАЩve turned the best of your travel photos into art, itтАЩs time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space, there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives, slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general, these sites are a pain to navigate. TheyтАЩre cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options  тАФ   Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?  тАФ   that if you donтАЩt have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if itтАЩs offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that itтАЩs not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans, ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David PogueтАЩs review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1, 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. ThatтАЩs one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best   place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn. offered тАЬthe best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested,тАЭ Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. LetтАЩs say you donтАЩt want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe youтАЩd rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself, perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally, I donтАЩt want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. ItтАЩs free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not   scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration, then go with a professional. However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos  тАФ   landscapes, food, monuments  тАФ   that youтАЩre keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: DonтАЩt tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely   activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you canтАЩt beat the price.
16	Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. тАЬI was very choked up,тАЭ Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. тАЬHow do you explain something that you never thought would happen? ItтАЩs going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. тАЭ It was a major moment for New YorkтАЩs sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  тАФ   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  тАФ   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nationтАЩs most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  тАФ   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nationтАЩs infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  тАФ   in New York, Washington and Boston  тАФ   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the cityтАЩs vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the cityтАЩs loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  тАФ   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on ManhattanтАЩs Far West Side in 2015 was the cityтАЩs first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. тАЬI donтАЩt think IтАЩve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,тАЭ she said through tears. тАЬThis woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. тАЭ She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. тАЬRepresentation matters,тАЭ they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. тАЬThere is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,тАЭ Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  тАФ   just barely  тАФ   with a lavish inaugural ride on New YearтАЩs Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authorityтАЩs chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authorityтАЩs chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. CuomoтАЩs voice came over the loudspeaker. тАЬRest assured: IтАЩm not driving the train,тАЭ he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. тАЬWeтАЩve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,тАЭ the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. тАЬHopefully, itтАЩs almost ready for us. тАЭ It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. тАЬWould you look at that guy?тАЭ Mr. Braith, 77, said. тАЬPretty handsome fellow if you ask me. тАЭ He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. BraithтАЩs mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. тАЬAre you famous?тАЭ a   asked, seeing the hubbub. тАЬIn the jazz world,тАЭ Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, тАЬWell, youтАЩre immortalized as far as IтАЩm concerned. тАЭ Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. тАЬI feel like IтАЩve been waiting for this train my whole life,тАЭ he said, seemingly speaking for many others.
17	  pages into the   journal found in Dylann S. RoofтАЩs car  тАФ   after the assertions of black inferiority, the lamentations over white powerlessness, the longing for a race war  тАФ   comes an incongruous declaration. тАЬI want state that I am morally opposed to psychology,тАЭ wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston, S. C. in June 2015. тАЬIt is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont. тАЭ Mr. Roof, who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday, apparently is devoted enough to that proposition (or delusion, as some maintain) to stake his life on it. Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution, he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background. тАЬI will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence,тАЭ he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16, a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms violations. At a hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf. The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. RoofтАЩs trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the churchтАЩs fellowship hall. It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it. With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself, the second phase  тАФ   when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison  тАФ   may prove little different. Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case. Mr. Roof, who also faces a death penalty trial in state court, has not publicly explained his reasoning. But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his   defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness. Mr. RoofтАЩs lead lawyer, David I. Bruck, tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase, knowing it might be his only chance. Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase, Judge Gergel allowed him little leeway. In his closing argument, while acknowledging Mr. RoofтАЩs guilt, Mr. Bruck managed to tell the jury that Mr. Roof subscribed to тАЬthe mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous, kind and gentle people he could ever have found. тАЭ Mr. Bruck seeded his speech with words like тАЬabnormal,тАЭ тАЬirrationality,тАЭ тАЬsenselessness,тАЭ тАЬdelusional,тАЭ тАЬobsessionтАЭ and тАЬperseveration,тАЭ a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response. Mr. Bruck, one of the countryтАЩs most experienced death penalty litigators, portrayed his    client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the F. B. I. how many he had killed, how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents. тАЬThere was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it,тАЭ Mr. Bruck said, тАЬand that is as much as he knows. тАЭ After receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in November, Judge Gergel found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial  тАФ   meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense. At Mr. BruckтАЩs request, the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for Monday, but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase. The judge has repeatedly warned Mr. Roof against representing himself, including immediately after the verdicts, when he called it тАЬa bad decisionтАЭ and urged him to тАЬfully appreciate the implications. тАЭ The warnings have had no discernible effect on Mr. Roof, who has until Tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel. That status allows Mr. Bruck and his team to offer guidance, but not to question witnesses or make objections. Prosecutors plan a procession of grief, perhaps calling dozens of members of victimsтАЩ families to testify about the impact of the killings. The prosecutors are also likely to   the considerable evidence of Mr. RoofтАЩs premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent. Death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive. тАЬIf the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing, intelligent choice to kill these innocent, churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred, they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs,тАЭ said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a research group. It would take only one holdout on the jury, which consists of 10 women and two men, to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. RoofтАЩs offer, through Mr. Bruck, to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. RoofтАЩs conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager, the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. тАЬThat could very well be the end of the death penalty in America, because if there was ever justification for killing anybody, this is the case,тАЭ Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victimsтАЩ families about Mr. RoofтАЩs fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty, it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law, those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. тАЬItтАЩs going to be extremely emotional, powerful testimony,тАЭ said John H. Blume, a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School, тАЬand that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when itтАЩs not the case. тАЭ If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death, it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law, according to experts on capital cases. That statute, which was broadened in 2009, does not carry a potential death sentence, but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury, given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. RoofтАЩs competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are тАЬcompetent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. тАЭ Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof, a   dropout, тАЬhas no right to represent himself in a capital trial, and even less so at the penalty phase. тАЭ But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of   for criminal defendants, in Faretta v. California, the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials, despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. RoofтАЩs defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. тАЬWhether or not theyтАЩre legally insane, thereтАЩs certainly something mentally wrong with them,тАЭ said Peter D. Greenspun, a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant, John A. Muhammad, for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added, тАЬTo have a person like that make this kind of decision, it really calls into question, from a philosophical point of view, whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties. тАЭ Mr. Muhammad, who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun, was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. тАЬItтАЩs something that Roof will likely regret,тАЭ Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. тАЬAt some point down the road, heтАЩs going to say, тАШWhat did I do?тАЩ And thereтАЩs no going back. тАЭ
18	MUMBAI, India  тАФ   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the countryтАЩs most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. ModiтАЩs bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime ministerтАЩs initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as тАЬblack money,тАЭ flowing through the countryтАЩs economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. тАЬEven though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,тАЭ said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his childrenтАЩs school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, тАЬWe need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. тАЭ Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. тАЬTrump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,тАЭ Mr. Prasad said in an interview. тАЬModi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins canтАЩt tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones. тАЭ Mr. Modi appeared on television on New YearтАЩs Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. тАЬToday Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,тАЭ Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. тАЬAs we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,тАЭ he said, referring to GandhiтАЩs nonviolent resistance movement, тАЬlet us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. тАЭ Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. тАЬItтАЩs a little bit crazy,тАЭ said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. тАЬWhen I first read the news, I couldnтАЩt even figure out if it was true. тАЭ The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  тАФ   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. ModiтАЩs   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of IndiaтАЩs ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. тАЬIf this move damages the economy, heтАЩs in for a rough ride,тАЭ said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. тАЬYou need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,тАЭ he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the countryтАЩs   life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. тАЬIn 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,тАЭ Mr. Pant said. тАЬHe was the precursor to whatтАЩs happening in the West. тАЭ Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the countryтАЩs red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as тАЬpeople who donтАЩt want change, who donтАЩt want reform,тАЭ Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. тАЬSo if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?тАЭ he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. тАЬWe canтАЩt shift to a cashless mode overnight,тАЭ he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. ModiтАЩs continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. тАЬSo far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,тАЭ Mr. Pant said. тАЬHe thinks he can continue to do it, but we really donтАЩt know. There are so many unknowns. тАЭ
19	BAGHDAD  тАФ   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President Fran├зois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   IraqтАЩs prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborersтАЩ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomberтАЩs vehicle, trying to get hired. тАЬThen a big boom came, sending them up into the air,тАЭ said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed тАЬthe most ineffective security forces in the worldтАЭ for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capitalтАЩs six million residents. тАЬWe have no idea who will kill at any moment and whoтАЩs supposed to protect us,тАЭ said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. тАЬIf the securities forces canтАЩt protect us, then allow us to do the job. тАЭ Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a тАЬ  incident,тАЭ without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.
20	SYDNEY, Australia  тАФ   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, AustraliaтАЩs   city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. тАЬItтАЩs poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,тАЭ said Anthony Boxshall, the agencyтАЩs manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the cityтАЩs bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A тАЬgoodтАЭ rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. тАЬFairтАЭ means that rainfall has affected the water. тАЬPoorтАЭ means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. тАЬWhen the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach,тАЭ said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. тАЬI was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now IтАЩm concerned about whether the water is clean. тАЭ Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beachesтАЩ water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.
21	When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to тАЬrun the tableтАЭ in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled RodgersтАЩ promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the teamтАЩs sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The SeahawksтАЩ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. тАЩs division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17тАЩs loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the teamтАЩs quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the teamтАЩs   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for MiamiтАЩs middling defense, even if TannehillтАЩs knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the RedskinsтАЩ plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the teamтАЩs quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City ChiefsтАЩ   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as CarrтАЩs backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.
22	Mariah Carey suffered through a performance train wreck in Times Square on New YearтАЩs Eve as malfunctions left her at a loss vocally during her hit song тАЬEmotions,тАЭ struggling to reach notes and to sync the lyrics and music. The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers, тАЬWe Belong Together,тАЭ while a recording of the song continued to play, a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday, a dispute erupted between Ms. CareyтАЩs representatives and producers of ABCтАЩs тАЬDick ClarkтАЩs New YearтАЩs RockinтАЩ Eve With Ryan Seacrest,тАЭ on which the singer was performing. Ms. CareyтАЩs manager, Stella Bulochnikov, charged that the showтАЩs producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  тАФ   and chose to continue showing Ms. CareyтАЩs messy performance тАЬto get ratings. тАЭ тАЬI will never know the truth, but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production,тАЭ Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. тАЬIтАЩm certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New YearтАЩs Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there, and they did not have theirтАЭ act together. Dick Clark Productions, which produced the show, issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. CareyтАЩs performance woes had nothing to do with the production, and that any suggestion that the company тАЬwould ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. тАЭ тАЬIn very rare instances, there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television,тАЭ the statement said, adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company тАЬhad no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. CareyтАЩs New YearтАЩs Eve performance. тАЭ A veteran audio producer, Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International, a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years, also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. тАЬEvery monitor and   device worked perfectly,тАЭ Mr. Goldstein said. тАЬ I canтАЩt comment beyond that and donтАЩt know what her nontechnical issue may have been. тАЭ A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. тАЬUnfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances,тАЭ the spokeswoman, Nicole Perna, told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey, a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years, was the final   act on ABCтАЩs тАЬDick ClarkтАЩs New YearтАЩs RockinтАЩ Eve With Ryan Seacrest. тАЭ She had just finished тАЬAuld Lang SyneтАЭ when her star turn began to spiral out of control. тАЬWe canтАЩt hear,тАЭ she said in the opening seconds of тАЬEmotionsтАЭ after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played, Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said, тАЬWeтАЩll just sing,тАЭ and noted proudly of her song, тАЬIt went to No. 1. тАЭ But she could not manage the notes that followed, and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. тАЬWeтАЩre missing some of these vocals, but it is what it is,тАЭ she said. тАЬLet the audience sing. тАЭ ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage, and at one point seemed to defend herself. тАЬIтАЩm trying to be a good sport here,тАЭ she said. When the number ended, the crowd cheered her on. тАЬThat was  тАФ   тАЭ she said, pausing for effect, тАЬamazing. тАЭ She seemed to recover at first with тАЬWe Belong Together,тАЭ but there appeared to be another malfunction, and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time, the prerecorded number kept playing. тАЬIt just donтАЩt get any better,тАЭ she said, and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance, Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an тАЬupsetтАЭ emoji, then wrote: тАЬHave a happy and healthy new year everybody! HereтАЩs to making more headlines in 2017. тАЭ An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. CareyтАЩs performance.
23	PARIS  тАФ   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March, Yves Ubelmann got a call from SyriaтАЩs director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training, Mr. Ubelmann, 36, had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects, mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra, parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous, was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad, his Syrian colleague, spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. тАЬDrones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details, every crack and hole, and we can take very precise measurements,тАЭ said Mr. Ubelmann, who founded the company Iconem. тАЬThis is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. тАЭ They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists, archaeologists and others, like Mr. Ubelmann, are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored, repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria, and also Iraq, that have suffered from war, looting and the Islamic State. тАЬPalmyra was very difficult,тАЭ Mr. Ubelmann said. тАЬThe terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. тАЭ The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris, where, through Jan. 9, many of the 40, 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called тАЬEternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra,тАЭ the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibitionтАЩs political importance, it was opened several weeks ago by President Fran├зois Hollande of France, who described it as тАЬan act of resistanceтАЭ against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage, he said, тАЬis the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate, destruction and death. тАЭ   Martinez, the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show, said the sites had been chosen because тАЬall are under threat from pillaging, neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. тАЭ He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion тАЬin the face of the devastation of unique heritage. тАЭ Besides images from Palmyra, the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos, immersing visitors in different eras, including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president, Bashar  . тАЬWe were working pro bono, not for any government, but to help the archaeologists,тАЭ he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists, he said, adding, тАЬWe also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. тАЭ What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year, his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently, it moved into   zones in Iraq, close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the warтАЩs effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3, 000 years, including Nineveh, Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud, where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015, Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. тАЬNimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities,тАЭ Layla Abdulkarim, a Syrian architect, said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new, specialists say, but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice тАЬwar archaeology,тАЭ that is, collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war, close to 150 archaeological projects were underway, just in Syria, researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in SyriaтАЩs old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria, the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. тАЬPeople are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms, but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible,тАЭ said Pascal Butterlin, a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence, even in the case of    ruins, Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari, near SyriaтАЩs border with Iraq. Before fleeing, the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq, he said. тАЬWe need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites,тАЭ he said. тАЬImportant evidence, like clandestine pits, can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. тАЭ Cheikhmous Ali, a Syrian archaeologist based in France, who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology, said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012, Mr. Ali said, and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts, they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed, objects carted off, safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris, which is drawing large crowds, coincides with тАЬHistory Begins in Mesopotamia,тАЭ a show at the LouvreтАЩs regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French governmentтАЩs active concern about cultural damage in Syria, which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest, condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as тАЬwar crimes. тАЭ This past month, France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates, provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the тАЬEternal SitesтАЭ opening at the Grand Palais, Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. тАЬShould we be concerned about the patrimony?тАЭ he asked. тАЬWhat is more important, saving lives or saving stones? In reality, these two are inseparable. тАЭ
24	Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George MichaelтАЩs тАЬFreedom! тАЩ90тАЭ video. Sure, other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era, and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna, Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a   makerтАЩs irresistible rhythms and lyrics, a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave тАЬFreedom! тАЩ90тАЭ a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  . Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. MichaelтАЩs 1990 album, тАЬListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,тАЭ brought together five models  тАФ   Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  тАФ   who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes, and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion, including the stylist Camilla Nickerson, the hairdresser Guido Palau, the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody, romantic   tones, тАЬFreedom! тАЩ90тАЭ had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. MichaelтАЩs unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week, some of the participants recalled their experiences on set, and some of the videoтАЩs most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell, model. WeтАЩd done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: тАЬIтАЩve been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you?тАЭ We were living in America, so I said youтАЩd have to fly us in, basically. I said yes, and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video, I didnтАЩt sleep at all, because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models, and it was the big finale of him designing, although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 oтАЩclock in the morning, and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel, packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didnтАЩt really give us parts, but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I donтАЩt think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit, but we didnтАЩt know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos, the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They donтАЩt have them anymore. Not that IтАЩve seen. MTVтАЩs changed. HasnтАЩt it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics, he sang there in London. We all did the finale, and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing тАЬFreedom. тАЭ After, he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden, and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. ThatтАЩs the memory IтАЩm going to keep. Guido Palau, hairdresser. I donтАЩt know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big, big production, a   video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day, though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They werenтАЩt playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian, Christy much more classic, Cindy the pinup, Tatjana this kind of film noir, and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They werenтАЩt prodded at all, though there were some surprises, like LindaтАЩs hair, which sheтАЩd done for a job for someone else. It wasnтАЩt like I said, тАЬOh, dye your hair blond,тАЭ not at all. At the time, we really didnтАЩt realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit na├пve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a   job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long, and at the end of the day, the red wine would come out. There weтАЩd be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz, model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so   this big, loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking, even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasnтАЩt on the set the day I was there, but IтАЩd met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine  тАФ   IтАЩm trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days, feminine glamour, people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the тАЩ40s and тАЩ50s  тАФ   Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasnтАЩt as saturated, not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names, and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry, which made it really fun. George was very nice, almost a little shy. Maybe thatтАЩs the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite   at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him, he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid, not one of those vivacious,   people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. ItтАЩs funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then, but this one in particular stood the test of time. ItтАЩs not like you look at тАЬFreedom! тАЩ90тАЭ now and say, тАЬOh, my God, itтАЩs so тАЩ80s!тАЭ ItтАЩs not like тАЬWorking Girl. тАЭ John Pearson, model. My agent called up and said: тАЬHey, do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it. тАЩтАЭ Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 oтАЩclock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly, and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. ThereтАЩs one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater thatтАЩs amazing. That wasnтАЩt rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way, never cheap and tawdry. George was there, very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long, and the producer said at the end of the day, тАЬCan we shoot you tomorrow?тАЭ I didnтАЩt have another job booked, so I said, тАЬSure. тАЭ Then he said, тАЬDo you mind doing it for nothing?тАЭ I said, тАЬNo way. тАЭ It was a little bit bolshie of me, but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end, I was paid $15, 000 for the day, which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous, beautiful girls. But IтАЩd been working nonstop for three years, and I wasnтАЩt going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy,    jobs, everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didnтАЩt realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne, actress, model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the тАЩ90s, and we didnтАЩt want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of тАЬFreedom!тАЭ came out and they were all in it, we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar, so I decided I was going to do тАЬFreedom!тАЭ and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus, we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then, but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were, whether it was Madonna with тАЬVogueтАЭ and тАЬTruth or DareтАЭ or George Michael with тАЬFreedom!тАЭ I donтАЩt know if he was openly gay or not, then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive, particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club, listening to тАЬFreedom! ,тАЭ it was an escape. Alan Hunter, one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didnтАЩt know where my career had gone. IтАЩd left MTV. My agent wasnтАЩt calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio, and on came George MichaelтАЩs new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant   capstone IтАЩd ever heard. It was his    song. He was saying, тАЬEverything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow. тАЭ Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography heтАЩd used in his past, and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket heтАЩd worn and the jukebox from тАЬFaith. тАЭ And he just steps away. He wasnтАЩt even in the video. It showed how serious he was, even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen, fashion designer. I was 10 years old, 10 or 11. IтАЩd see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in тАЬOpen Your Heart. тАЭ But what I remember about тАЬFreedom!тАЭ was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial, Corinne Day,   space. ThereтАЩs water dripping down the walls and George MichaelтАЩs leather jacket is on fire, and the models are naked. It was really the glamour of the тАЩ80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come.
25	WASHINGTON  тАФ   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  тАФ   refashioning the countryтАЩs social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  тАФ   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care ActтАЩs repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. TrumpтАЩs cabinet nominees. тАЬItтАЩs a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,тАЭ said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. тАЬAnd we intend to do it. тАЭ But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The partyтАЩs brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. TrumpтАЩs   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New YearтАЩs wishes тАЬto all,тАЭ including тАЬthose who have fought me and lost so badly they just donтАЩt know what to do. тАЭ) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  тАФ   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. тАЬTheyтАЩve been given a golden opportunity here,тАЭ said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. тАЬBut I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. тАЬIf you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,тАЭ Mr. Lott continued. тАЬYou have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. тАЭ The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. TrumpтАЩs chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats  тАФ   including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York  тАФ   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. TrumpтАЩs agenda. тАЬAfter campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   TrumpтАЩs postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after heтАЩs sworn in,тАЭ said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. тАЬDemocrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. тАЭ Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. тАЬI hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,тАЭ the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. тАЬI think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. тАЭ In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rulesтАЩ completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  тАФ   already a quarter over  тАФ   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. ObamaтАЩs, and they may delay the repeal measureтАЩs effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. TrumpтАЩs cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. TrumpтАЩs nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. тАЬThe senator doesnтАЩt want to rush,тАЭ said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnellтАЩs refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  тАФ   and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  тАФ   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the partyтАЩs leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. тАЬThis is no time for hubris,тАЭ Mr. McConnell said. тАЬYou have to perform. тАЭ
26	WASHINGTON  тАФ   ItтАЩs   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nationтАЩs health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. тАЬWhen you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,тАЭ said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. тАЬThere is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. тАЭ That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. GarlandтАЩs nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  тАФ   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  тАФ   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the тАЬvote no, hope yesтАЭ caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isnтАЩt the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. тАЬA Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,тАЭ Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the partyтАЩs weekly radio address on Saturday. тАЬWe assume that responsibility with the promise that weтАЩll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. тАЭ тАЬI am pretty giddy,тАЭ said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.

28	The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003, outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten, deprived of sleep, forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis,   Donald J. TrumpтАЩs nominee for secretary of defense, was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death, which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. тАЬGeneral Mattis was all up in arms over this,тАЭ Ralph Dengler, then a lieutenant colonel, testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as тАЬthe worst thing that happenedтАЭ under his watch in the Iraq war. тАЬI was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths,тАЭ Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the generalтАЩs handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview in late November, said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the countryтАЩs 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding, adding that тАЬonly a stupid person would say it doesnтАЩt work. тАЭ General Mattis does not support abusive techniques, let alone waterboarding. тАЬGive me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers,тАЭ he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November, according to the   тАЬand I do better with that than I do with torture. тАЭ The generalтАЩs beliefs were shaped by his military training, but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment, according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor, who was General MattisтАЩs spokesman during much of that time, said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles тАЬmakes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask, тАШWhat am I fighting for? тАЩтАЭ Colonel Taylor said. тАЬThat is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of,тАЭ he added. As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  тАФ   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  тАФ   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But, several friends say, he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006, General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. тАЬTorture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option, even if lives depend on gaining information,тАЭ the manual said. тАЬLose moral legitimacy, lose the war. тАЭ General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  тАФ   including waterboarding, forced nudity and sensory deprivation, tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which later fell under the generalтАЩs command. That program, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, also known as SERE, exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive, whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, and as an overall leader of the American war effort, General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. тАЩs treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guant├бnamo Bay, Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement, General Mattis opposed the release, before the end of hostilities, of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However, he added, they should be treated humanely, in accordance with international and domestic law. тАЬI would go by the Geneva Conventions, and maintain them, with Red Cross oversight, until the war is over,тАЭ he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt. тАЬFor his whole career, heтАЩs believed that it just doesnтАЩt pay dividends,тАЭ said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The тАЬpack of cigarettesтАЭ reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that   can go a long way. тАЬIтАЩm not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture,тАЭ Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. TrumpтАЩs transition team, declined requests for more detail on the  тАЩs discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General MattisтАЩs beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administrationтАЩs departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  тАФ   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  тАФ   tainted the United StatesтАЩ reputation while not yielding results. тАЬIneffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera,тАЭ Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. тАЬA very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, weтАЩve lost who we are. тАЭ The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manualтАЩs section on intelligence collection states: тАЬUse of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. тАЭ The manual adds, тАЬCruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. тАЭ As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab, had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  тАФ   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel GalloтАЩs opinion, the   treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. HatabтАЩs death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of   tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: тАЬNo better friend, no worse enemy. тАЭ The addition was, тАЬFirst, do no harm. тАЭ
29	ISTANBUL  тАФ   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New YearтАЩs Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, describing the gunman who carried out the assault  тАФ   and who has not been identified or captured  тАФ   as тАЬa hero soldier of the caliphate. тАЭ The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman, who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle, but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman, captured by security cameras, that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The governmentтАЩs spokesman, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailantтАЩs fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically, but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack, which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Kurtulmus said: тАЬThe fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is, тАШWe will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.тАЩ And we say to them, we will break into your caves wherever you are. тАЭ The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan, as saying, тАЬAccording to preliminary information, this information is doubtful, but we are checking all the same. тАЭ The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out тАЬin continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. тАЭ тАЬA hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs, where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday,тАЭ read the statement from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. тАЬThey used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. тАЭ In an apparent reference to TurkeyтАЩs role in the conflict in Syria, the statement warned that тАЬthe government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims, which it is targeting with its planes and its guns, will cause a fire in its home by GodтАЩs will. тАЭ The statement did not name the assailant, and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic StateтАЩs claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State, but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November, when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey, trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years, Turkey looked the other way, according to analysts and regional diplomats, as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border, establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria, Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed, as Turkey worked to secure its borders, under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey, prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria, killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey, warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were тАЬcontinuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout TurkeyтАЭ in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, assassinated Andrey G. Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, at an art gallery in the capital, Ankara. The gunman shouted тАЬGod is great!тАЭ and тАЬDonтАЩt forget Aleppo, donтАЩt forget Syria!тАЭ during the attack, which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified, The Associated Press reported. At least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.
30	WASHINGTON  тАФ   President ObamaтАЩs advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. ObamaтАЩs longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. тАЬThe fever in this room has finally broken,тАЭ the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. тАЬWeтАЩre no longer in   mode. тАЭ What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States  тАФ   after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2, 000 American lives lost  тАФ   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, тАЬthe counterterrorism challenges are real. тАЭ As bleak as AfghanistanтАЩs prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  тАФ   the тАЬgood warтАЭ to George W. BushтАЩs тАЬbad warтАЭ in Iraq  тАФ   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. тАЬWe shouldnтАЩt assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,тАЭ the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, тАЬthat war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. тАЭ More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. ObamaтАЩs thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. тАЬWhen it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,тАЭ he said in the interview, тАЬthat this is a long slog. тАЭ Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a тАЬdumb war. тАЭ But in the same speech he also said, тАЬI donтАЩt oppose all wars. тАЭ He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. тАЬI would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,тАЭ he told the crowd that day in ChicagoтАЩs Federal Plaza. By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  тАФ   the тАЬgood war,тАЭ in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administrationтАЩs troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. тАЬThis is a war that we have to win,тАЭ he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50, 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country тАЬprecarious and urgent. тАЭ More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70, 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. ObamaтАЩs military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  тАФ   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a   government. The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40, 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. тАЬThere was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,тАЭ said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. тАЬI donтАЩt believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview. тАЭ тАЬIn many ways, I think, he deferred,тАЭ said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  тАФ   20, 000, for example  тАФ   look like a path to certain defeat. тАЬPresident Obama was asking the military for broad options,тАЭ said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. ObamaтАЩs ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only тАЬvariationsтАЭ on тАЬthe more robust counterinsurgency model. тАЭ Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? тАЬWhen he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,тАЭ Mr. Eikenberry said. тАЬBut what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. тАЭ Given Mr. ObamaтАЩs innate wariness of   it didnтАЩt take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the PentagonтАЩs Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. тАЬWe canтАЩt worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,тАЭ he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. тАЬObama believes the military can do enormous things,тАЭ said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. тАЬIt can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military canтАЩt create a political culture or build a society. тАЭ By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept тАЬAfghan good enough. тАЭ The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100, 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, тАЬWow, this place looks great!тАЭ The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. ObamaтАЩs conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over AfghanistanтАЩs security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an тАЬenduring partnershipтАЭ between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that AmericaтАЩs experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. тАЬOne year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,тАЭ he said. тАЬThe goal I set  тАФ   to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild  тАФ   is now within our reach. тАЭ Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  тАФ   on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  тАФ   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was тАЬvery aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because IтАЩd worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. тАЭ Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. тАЬThe most underappreciated part of foreign policy,тАЭ Mr. Rhodes said, тАЬis dealing with flawed partners. тАЭ When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. тАЬThe mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,тАЭ said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. тАЬISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,тАЭ Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. ObamaтАЩs war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. тАЬIt doesnтАЩt matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,тАЭ he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a тАЬbroken recordтАЭ on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10, 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend тАЬwell beyond your presidency,тАЭ according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. тАЬThis goes to the politics of what IтАЩm leaving for the next president,тАЭ he told the group, according to one of the participants. тАЬMy interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,тАЭ he added, referring to troop numbers, тАЬbut to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. тАЭ Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10, 000 from more than 100, 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. тАЬAfghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,тАЭ Mr. Obama said. The country тАЬwas riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. ItтАЩs still there. тАЭ In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  тАФ   a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. тАЬItтАЩs very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,тАЭ he said. тАЬAs commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,тАЭ he went on, тАЬI spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And IтАЩm not satisfied weтАЩve got it perfect yet. тАЭ
31	With the year winding down and New YearтАЩs resolutions just around the corner, itтАЩs time to gear up for that   clutter purge. But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer  тАФ   or even taking down the decorations  тАФ   can be overwhelming. So to help motivate you, several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets, beat back the toys taking over the living room and, yes, finally deal with that junk drawer. START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized, use small containers you already have on hand, like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons. Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper, or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store. For strings of lights and garlands, use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use (tree lights, porch lights, balcony, bushes, etc. ). Zip ties can also be used on wreaths, so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner. To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards, тАЬsave only those that are meaningful and special,тАЭ Tova Weinstock, a professional organizer in Brooklyn, said. тАЬFor the others, appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash. тАЭ EDIT YOUR CLOSET Eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done. тАЬI donтАЩt believe in тАШIf you havenтАЩt used or worn something in a year, get rid of it,тАЩтАЭ said Laura Cattano, another organizer in Brooklyn. тАЬHow you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past. тАЭ Focus on the image you would like to project, she said, then start at one end of the closet and review each piece, pulling out those you know you can toss, donate or sell. Try on anything you havenтАЩt worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be тАЬyour new favorite thing,тАЭ she said, while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering, ask yourself, тАЬDoes it тАШspark joy? тАЩтАЭ) Sort clothes by type, grouping pants together, then shirts or blouses, jackets or dresses. тАЬIf you canтАЩt see it, you wonтАЩt wear it,тАЭ said Sharon Lowenheim, an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess. тАЬSo remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger. тАЭ Arranging shirts by sleeve length, with the shortest at the front, makes them easier to find, said Ms. Lowenheim, who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section, then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. тАЬIf you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front, that is a signal to you that you just donтАЩt like that item,тАЭ she said. тАЬGet rid of it. тАЭ Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store   clothes out of sight, said Faith Roberson, an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and youтАЩve done fine without them, тАЬit changes your perspective,тАЭ she said. тАЬYou can honestly ask yourself, тАШDo I actually love this piece? And if I donтАЩt, why am I holding onto it? тАЩтАЭ TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. тАЬFinding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child,тАЭ said Ms. Lowenheim, whose    daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday, starting when she was a toddler. Before that, Ms. Lowenheim said, she would sneak into her daughterтАЩs room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. тАЬWhen she was around 3, she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it,тАЭ Ms. Lowenheim said. тАЬAt that point, I realized that I had to involve her in the process. тАЭ If they cooperate, be sure to respect their decision, Ms. Roberson said, even if they choose something you wouldnтАЩt have. тАЬParents think about the money theyтАЩve spent,тАЭ she said, or the sentimental value, which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with, either online or at a garage sale, and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down, Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. тАЬThey are stackable, they have dividers, are easy to clean, easy to label, and they come in four different sizes,тАЭ she said. To help maintain order, тАЬlabel where each toy goes,тАЭ said Ms. Lowenheim, who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints, jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read, label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has тАЬa homeтАЭ to return to at the end of the day, she said, cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER . .. тАЬDonтАЩt waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece,тАЭ Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop, divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not, where else could it go? тАЬTake it easy, and go pile by pile,тАЭ she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you donтАЩt need, like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy, buy a drawer organizer, suggested Ms. Lowenheim, who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. тАЬThe key thing is to measure the drawer, then find the organizer that best fits the space,тАЭ she said. тАЬIf itтАЩs too small, it wonтАЩt help. тАЭ The reward? тАЬKeeping everything sorted by type,тАЭ she said, тАЬwill make it easier for you to find something when you need it. тАЭ
32	JERUSALEM  тАФ   Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned тАЬunder caution,тАЭ the police said in a statement, implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. тАЬNo further details can be given at this stage,тАЭ the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433, a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit, with the authorization of the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement, the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses, some abroad, and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes, the statement said, other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu, who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges, has vehemently denied any impropriety. тАЬThis will all come to nothing, because there is nothing,тАЭ he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases, one more serious than the other, but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one, according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets, concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu, and possibly for members of his family, given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder, a conservative American businessman and philanthropist, and a close friend of Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs, when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. LauderтАЩs arrival in Israel, he was asked to meet with the Israeli police тАЬand respond to questions related to an investigation, to which Mr. Lauder is not a party,тАЭ Helena Beilin, a Tel   lawyer representing Mr. Lauder, said in a statement. тАЬAfter a short meeting the following day, he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case. тАЭ Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs office, suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt, issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. тАЬTry to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes, as is accepted in democracies,тАЭ it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament, тАЬWe hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition. тАЭ тАЬHold off the celebrations donтАЩt rush,тАЭ he added. тАЬIтАЩve told you before and will tell you again  тАФ   this will come to nothing, because there is nothing. тАЭ Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office, and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately, lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him, talking up IsraelтАЩs diplomatic and economic achievements, and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu, generally a popular prime minister, has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration, he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with   Donald J. Trump, who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs opponents, the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope, even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. тАЬThis creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics,тАЭ said Nahum Barnea, a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand, Mr. Barnea said, there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other, he said, the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu, who has no natural heir in his party, was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog, the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament, said it was тАЬa tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation. тАЭ He added, тАЬWe are not expressing satisfaction at anotherтАЩs misfortune. тАЭ Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid, the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, which has challenged Likud in recent polls, said, тАЬThe presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli, including the prime minister. тАЭ He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country, saying, тАЬA person who is being investigated is a person under pressure. тАЭ Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation, unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless, the accusations could chip away at Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs standing. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption, although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February, Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a тАЬprime minister up to his neck in investigationsтАЭ and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s, Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct, and that of people around him, though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture  тАФ   the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime ministerтАЩs official residence with an identical, old set in their private home in Caesarea  тАФ   to a more recent one involving a   deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines, and other naval equipment purchased by Israel, giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode, too, Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer, David Shimron, have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs relationship with Arnaud Mimran, a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year, and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign, has also prompted suspicions of impropriety.
33	PARIS  тАФ   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations, universal health care and fine food and wine, the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created тАЬright to disconnect. тАЭ Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours, it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time, and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employerтАЩs demands intrude on evenings at home, treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. тАЬEmployees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office,тАЭ Myriam El Khomri, the minister of labor, said last year in justifying the need for the law. тАЬThe boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous,тАЭ and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent, she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails, but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the тАЬreply allтАЭ function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond, rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  тАФ   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots, but also a commitment to personal liberties, France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal, but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy, it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year, and sometimes far longer, because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now, if both members of the couple agree on the divorce, lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement, jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  тАФ   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  тАФ   but the country is now following many others in requiring тАЬneutral packagingтАЭ for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand, cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the countryтАЩs gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags, French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic, a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused, or paper bags. At Monoprix, a supermarket chain, paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals, which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago, it took quite some time to change the culture, although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019, the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  тАФ   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies, but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods, like frozen dinners, to be labeled тАЬproduit dтАЩorigine fran├зaiseтАЭ only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born, raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of тАЬMade in AmericaтАЭ is тАЬRaised in France. тАЭ
34	OTTAWA  тАФ   It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport, bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun, Mexico. There was one problem, however. The flightтАЩs captain was passed out in the cockpit, apparently from drinking. The police in Calgary, Alberta, arrested the pilot, Miroslav Gronych, 37, on Saturday and have charged him with two   offenses. тАЬThis is a new one, and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane,тАЭ Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference. тАЬThereтАЩs just so many checks and balances, it just doesnтАЩt surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate. тАЭ Nevertheless, Inspector Ken Thrower, the commander of the Calgary Police ServiceтАЩs traffic and airport unit, said his officers, along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada, the aviation regulator, will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints, including airport security, while obviously inebriated. Mr. Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while impaired, and having care and control of an aircraft while testing for more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. тАЬHe was pretty high,тАЭ Sergeant Stacey said, adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight. The aircraft was operated by Sunwing Airlines, a   carrier based in Toronto. SunwingтАЩs gate agents found the pilotтАЩs behavior to be unusual and alerted the  . The   then discovered the pilot slumped in the captainтАЩs seat and тАЬseverely impaired by alcohol,тАЭ Sergeant Stacey said. Transport Canada, which did not respond to requests for comment, is conducting a separate investigation, which is likely to result in additional charges, the police said. Inspector Thrower said Mr. Gronych is from Slovenia and is in Canada on a work visa. He will appear in court again on Thursday. After some delay, the flight did take off with a new crew. Sunwing did not respond to requests for comment. Janine Massey, a spokeswoman, told The Associated Press that the carrier was тАЬvery apologetic for any upset that this has caused and would like to assure our customers that safety remains our utmost priority. тАЭ
35	RIO DE JANEIRO  тАФ   A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead, the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday. Riots at BrazilтАЩs prisons are common, but the episode in Manaus, which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary, ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades. Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison, which held more than 1, 200 inmates, about triple its official capacity. тАЬI never saw anything like this in my life,тАЭ Judge Lu├нs Carlos Valois, who helped negotiate an end to the riot, said in a Facebook post. He said that dozens of people had been killed, but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count: тАЬThere were lots of bodies. Many of them were dismembered. тАЭ The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours, raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2. 1 million. Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region. The authorities said that one of the gangs, Familia do Norte (Family of the North) which operates from the Manaus prisons, was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot. The targets were from First Capital Command, a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of S├гo Paulo in southeast Brazil. тАЬThere were deaths only on one side,тАЭ S├йrgio Fontes, the top security official in Amazonas State, told reporters. тАЬThe Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command, and one or another guys who werenтАЩt on their good side at the moment. тАЭ The riot drew comparisons with the 1992 uprising at the Carandiru prison in S├гo Paulo, when police forces stormed the building and 111 inmates were killed. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings, raising criticism from human rights groups. Since that episode, the Brazilian authorities have vowed to alleviate overcrowding in the countryтАЩs prisons and combat prison gangs. But soaring numbers of convictions for relatively minor drug offenses have pushed prison populations upward, the gangsтАЩ clout is growing, and riots continue to erupt frequently all over the country. In the riot in Manaus, inmates took dozens of fellow prisoners hostage. They also seized 12 employees of Umanizzare, a private contractor that operates prisons in the Amazon. Negotiators eventually won the release of the hostages by assuring the inmates that they would not be harmed or transferred to other prisons. Security specialists say that Brazil could experience more riots like the one in Manaus as P. C. C. the S├гo Paulo gang, extends its reach around the country. Familia do Norte, the Manaus gang, recently formed an alliance with Red Command, a gang that has been losing ground to P. C. C. in parts of Rio de Janeiro.
36	After the explosion in September of one of its rockets, SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space, the company announced on Monday, with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday. In a statement, SpaceX  тАФ   or more formally, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  тАФ   said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence. The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations  тАФ   the fueling of propellants  тАФ   about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the   rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa. Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites. With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitorтАЩs building nearby. тАЬThe accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,тАЭ SpaceX said in its statement. The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the   liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank. In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust. But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid. тАЬReally surprising problem thatтАЩs never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,тАЭ Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November. Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said. Tests at SpaceXтАЩs facilities in Hawthorne, Calif. and McGregor, Tex. supported that conclusion, the company said. The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said. The next SpaceX launch is to carry a   of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car. A month ago, Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in   but less than a week later, SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January. The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month.
37	In the basement of a mammoth old building in Upper Manhattan that houses the Yeshiva University High School for Boys sits a cramped gym that is home to the high schoolтАЩs floor hockey team, known as the Lions. The school calls the gym the LionsтАЩ Den, but many visitors call it the Dungeon and liken playing there to playing hockey inside a box. Games are raucous affairs with rough play and frenzied fans squeezed onto the narrow bleachers at one end, between the squads of panting players. Several miles away, in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, is the comparatively luxurious indoor rink at the Salanter Akiba Riverdale High School, known as S. A. R. With its sturdy boards and rounded sides, the rink resembles a real ice hockey surface. Its scoreboard is flanked by American and Israeli flags. Between these two extremes exists the   but thriving world of interscholastic floor hockey at yeshiva high schools in New York City and surrounding towns. The game in these Orthodox Jewish private schools stretches back at least to the late 1970s, but in recent years, it has grown enormously popular. The championship match can fill an arena with as many as 1, 000 fans, with more people watching live online. Players in elementary grades at Jewish schools now set their sights on yeshivas with the most powerful hockey programs. тАЬOutside the Orthodox community, this is a foreign thing,тАЭ said Amir Gavarin, 22, a former floor hockey league player. тАЬBut inside, itтАЩs a whole world unto itself, and supercompetitive. тАЭ The teams play in the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Hockey League, which includes 18 varsity and 15 junior varsity teams for boys. There are also 12 girlsтАЩ teams, which play in the spring season. The game is similar to ice hockey, but played on foot on a gym floor with a hard orange ball and   squads made up of a goalie and four roaming players. Goalies wear full padding, but the other players wear sweatpants, jerseys and helmets with face masks. Under the jersey, some players wear a tallit katan, a religious garment with knotted fringes, or zizit. Blatant body checking is banned, but there is plenty of contact. The teams play mostly in conventional gyms set up with temporary barriers. Orthodox youngsters are often introduced to the game in summer camp or by friends from their synagogue, and end up playing in one of the many youth leagues that have cropped up in Orthodox neighborhoods, before joining teams in middle school. тАЬIn some New Jersey yeshivas, floor hockey is more popular than basketball,тАЭ said Yoni Stone, the varsity coach at the Yeshiva University High School for Boys. тАЬForget high school  тАФ   every single day school has a team, and the kids start in the youth leagues. тАЭ Players, abiding by their religious tenets, use the sport as an outlet between long hours spent studying Judaic texts and other subjects. Since they observe the Sabbath, there is no play on Friday evenings or Saturdays before sundown. The season runs from late October through March. On a weeknight last month, the Lions made their dramatic pregame entrance to blaring rock music. They were there to take on the Cobras from the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston, N. J. a school financed by the family of Jared Kushner, the    of   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Kushner himself was proficient at the sport, having played for the Frisch School in Paramus, N. J. when he was a teenager. The Cobras wound up beating the Lions, a fatiguing feat since the ball rarely escapes the playing area, making for almost nonstop action. Each game has three periods, with each period lasting 12 minutes. In fact, the team from the Ramaz School on ManhattanтАЩs Upper East Side prepared to play at the LionsтАЩ gym by having one of its players, a senior training to enter the Israeli Army, put his teammates through rigorous military exercises. The Ramaz School holds games in a modern, brightly lit gym that is a far cry from the LionsтАЩ Den. One night last month, the Rams of Ramaz took on the visiting Thunder from the Rav Teitz Mesivta Academy, or R. T. M. A. from Elizabeth, N. J. and won the game in   overtime, prompting a celebratory mob of Ramaz players. At certain powerhouses, hockey is perhaps the most prominent sport, and rivalries have developed between neighboring yeshivas. In Brooklyn, the games can be particularly intense whenever the Magen David Yeshivah or the Yeshivah of Flatbush, both in Midwood, or the Yeshivat Darche Eres in Sheepshead Bay, face off. тАЬTheyтАЩre seeing all these kids in synagogue the next day, so that creates a certain competitiveness,тАЭ Mr. Stone said. When rivals in the Five Towns section of Long Island play, тАЬthe whole town shuts downтАЭ for games that can attract hundreds of spectators, said David Kolb, a hockey writer for MSG Networks and the operator of Camp Dovid, a summer hockey camp in Pennsylvania where campers wear the names of their yeshivas on their jerseys. Two top teams in the Five Towns  тАФ   the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway and the D. R. S. Yeshiva High School for Boys  тАФ   have nurtured a   rivalry. And in the league final in 2014, when the Hebrew Academy finally avenged years of losses with a victory, тАЬyou would have thought the messiah had come,тАЭ said Seth Gordon, the hockey commissioner for the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League. тАЬSome of these rivalries start in elementary school, with the seeds planted when these kids are in sixth grade,тАЭ Mr. Gordon said. Though the sport has drawn a loyal and passionate following, the athletes are ultimately religious students who are urged to put their spiritual priorities before their athletic ones. тАЬItтАЩs common with the Jewish identity that we canтАЩt do certain things because of the boundaries of observant Jewish life, so we create our own parameters and do it to the fullest,тАЭ Mr. Gavarin said. Mayer Schiller, a Hasidic rabbi who in the 1990s coached Yeshiva University High School to six consecutive league championships, is recognized as the progenitor of the yeshiva floor hockey scene. He was hard to miss, since he coached wearing his black hat and coat. Rabbi Schiller, 65, still an avid fan of rock, pop and punk music, established the now popular tradition of having players enter the gym to loud music. The rabbiтАЩs choice: the Ramones. He grew up playing roller hockey in Queens. In the late 1970s, with New YorkтАЩs professional basketball teams sagging, students began rooting for two local hockey teams, the Rangers and the Islanders, Rabbi Schiller recalled. Rabbi Schiller was a devout Rangers fan who was particularly fond of the raucous play of Nick Fotiu, a native of Staten Island who became a brawler for the Rangers. The rabbi formed a team at the Ramaz School in 1979, and helped organize a fledgling yeshiva hockey league with a   teams that grew significantly over the years. He regarded coaching as a form of spiritual service and striving at sports as a complement to studying sacred texts and worshiping God. тАЬIf God didnтАЩt mean for this greatness to exist, why did he give us Gretzky and Jordan?тАЭ Rabbi Schiller said. On a recent weeknight, the S. A. R. team  тАФ   which includes Mr. KolbтАЩs two sons, Gordie and Henri  тАФ   was put through   drills and scrimmaging by its longtime head coach, Howie Falkenstein. Mr. Falkenstein also runs a hockey program at the Westchester Summer Day camp in Mamaroneck, N. Y. and a league in the Bronx that attracts players from across the region. Its youngest level is the Mites division, which is open to first and second graders. Mr. Falkenstein was getting his team ready for its game against the Frisch School and had players practicing penalty shots. Gordie, the S. A. R. StingтАЩs captain, deftly scored on his brother, a goalie, prompting a chorus of hoots from teammates. S. A. R. wound up beating Frisch, solidifying its status as one of the leagueтАЩs top teams. тАЬItтАЩs definitely its own niche, but itтАЩs still hockey and it has the team camaraderie that people are looking for,тАЭ Mr. Falkenstein said. тАЬIt has the same excitement when you score a goal or make a save. тАЭ
38	Writers are different from the rest of us. Their castoff scraps can be worth money, not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars. Jonathan Lethem, 52, recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive. The Beinecke Rare Book  Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts, letters, notes and other artifacts, which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman, Sinclair Lewis, James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection. Mr. LethemтАЩs papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of BrooklynтАЩs literary ascendance, including тАЬMotherless BrooklynтАЭ (1999) and тАЬThe Fortress of SolitudeтАЭ (2003). But as befits a lifelong collector, music obsessive, comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture, there are also   cartoons, New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection. тАЬFor an author who is so much fun as a novelist, itтАЩs interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well,тАЭ said Melissa Barton, the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke. (Ms. Barton, citing library policy, declined to say what Yale paid in the sale, which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz.) Mr. LethemтАЩs archive also includes two computer hard drives, a laptop and other digital materials, especially from more recent years. тАЬYou can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera,тАЭ Mr. Lethem, whose most recent novel, тАЬA GamblerтАЩs Anatomy,тАЭ appeared in October, said in an interview. But the bulk of the collection consists of   artifacts, some of them charmingly weird. We asked Mr. Lethem, who left New York in 2010 to teach creative writing at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. about some of the odder items in his literary closet. The archive includes a number of   comic books Mr. Lethem made as a child, featuring invented superheroes like   Man, whose origin story included an   attempt to start a nudist colony in Alaska. In one installment,   Man (who later got a passing   in тАЬThe Fortress of SolitudeтАЭ) battled Ed Koch, who was no hero to Mr. LethemтАЩs   bohemian parents. тАЬI didnтАЩt make multiple copies to sell or anything,тАЭ he said. тАЬIt was more like I was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where   Man was a real comic. тАЭ Mr. Lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie тАЬThe WarriorsтАЭ in the   subway station in Brooklyn, which was standing in for the Times Square station. тАЬThis was my subway stop, and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd Street seemed absurd,тАЭ Mr. Lethem recalled. тАЬI remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie. Nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important. тАЭ The archive contains typescripts of his novels, often affixed with alternate titles. (Would тАЬMotherless BrooklynтАЭ have been a hit if it had been called тАЬJerks From NowhereтАЭ?) The earliest is тАЬApes in the Plan,тАЭ an unpublished тАЬfake Philip K. Dick novel,тАЭ as Mr. Lethem put it, named for a Devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23. тАЬI wrote three novels on an electric typewriter,тАЭ he said. тАЬIf I live long enough, I could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that. тАЭ This diary tracking his writing progress, social interactions, exercise and, um, digestion comes from the   when Mr. Lethem had dropped out of Bennington College and moved to Berkeley, Calif. to try to become a writer. тАЬI had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum,тАЭ he said. тАЬI had no visible means of support, nor was anyone expecting to hear from me. This kind of weird   probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question тАШWho are you and what did you actually do today? тАЩтАЭ About those drawings of vomiting cats   тАж     тАЬFor about 15 years, every time I had a really good dance party that went late, with people lolling around drunk and exhausted, at about 2 a. m. I would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat,тАЭ Mr. Lethem said. тАЬI ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings, some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers. тАЭ Some of the goofy character names in Mr. LethemтАЩs novels are drawn from   lists he typed up early in his career, a habit he connects with the wordplay of тАЬMotherless Brooklyn,тАЭ whose narrator has TouretteтАЩs syndrome. Mr. Lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an Oliver Sacks essay about a surgeon with TouretteтАЩs who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as тАЬcandy for the mind. тАЭ тАЬHe was collecting real names,тАЭ Mr. Lethem said. тАЬBut when I read that, I thought, тАШOh my God, thatтАЩs me. тАЩтАЭ Names from this list showed up in тАЬGun, With Occasional MusicтАЭ (1994) and тАЬChronic CityтАЭ (2009). тАЬThe Fortress of Solitude,тАЭ inspired by Mr. LethemтАЩs Brooklyn childhood, describes a   store called Samuel J. Underberg, тАЬa site of mysterious life,тАЭ where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging. While writing, Mr. Lethem acquired some random items from the real UnderbergтАЩs (now demolished) which are shown here with a 1978 Billboard Hot 100 list, an old calendar and other research materials. тАЬI became a collector of all this tawdry used signage,тАЭ he said. тАЬI just thought it was really weird and cool. тАЭ The archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists, including Donna Tartt, Paul Auster, Suzanne Vega, Jennifer Egan, Thomas Berger and Ursula K. Le Guin. This missive, written on an airline safety card, is from the novelist David Bowman, who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012. тАЬAll his letters were like mail art,тАЭ Mr. Lethem said. тАЬDavid had a great, crazy brain. He never stopped covering the world in language. тАЭ
39	In 2007, Rey Canunayon and his wife, MaryGwen, immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. In doing so, they were fulfilling their familyтАЩs dreams. For years, her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still, he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. тАЬAmerica is a great nation, a kind nation, a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities,тАЭ Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived, they stayed with Ms. CanunayonтАЩs family in New Jersey. Life was exciting, even relaxing, Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country, he struggled to find work and grew despondent. тАЬOh, my God, I have cried a river because I was in a depression,тАЭ said Mr. Canunayon, now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway, one station to the next, so long as it kept moving. тАЬWhen you come from a place where you are so familiar, your own country, you have friends, relatives, connections, a career. And then youтАЩre stripped of everything except your dignity itтАЩs really hard,тАЭ he said. Eventually, the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst, Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry, while his wife, 49, is a babysitter, a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015, they received their green cards. Beyond that, Mr. Canunayon, who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines, has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time, he is not collecting a paycheck for it. тАЬGod gave knowledge for free, skills for free, talent for free, so IтАЩll give it for free,тАЭ Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the coupleтАЩs place of worship in Elmhurst, St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. тАЬI cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have,тАЭ he said. But because this effort doesnтАЩt come with a salary, it doesnтАЩt help pay the bills. It took one episode, when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September, for them to plummet into financial instability. тАЬIt was a big problem, Mr. Canunayon said. тАЬWhat will happen to us if we canтАЩt pay the rent?тАЭ He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate, where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins, a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group, Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help, providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the coupleтАЩs outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance, they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet, sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. тАЬItтАЩs the same situation, financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle,тАЭ Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines, he worked in research, advocacy and policy legislation, which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. тАЬI would be killing myself if I did something else,тАЭ he said. тАЬIt would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing, itтАЩs not work. тАЭ
40	WASHINGTON  тАФ   It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill  тАФ   a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump. By noon, party leaders had a message for their charges: It was not going smoothly. The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body, members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar. By midmorning, Mr. Trump had weighed in, questioning the membersтАЩ priorities on Twitter. Shortly after, lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader  тАФ   who, along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, had opposed the proposal  тАФ   lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans, according to two people present: Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act, or tinkering with an ethics office? Minutes later, members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped. The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans, meeting in a secret session, voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers, including three who were sent to jail. It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington, marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans, led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges. Instead, they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful House Ethics Committee to shut down inquiries. They even sought to block the small staff at the Office of Congressional Ethics, which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of House lawmakers, from speaking to the news media. тАЬIt has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place, and itтАЩs cost members of Congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations,тАЭ Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said Tuesday, still defending the move. But such resolve crumbled Tuesday morning, as thousands of phone calls flooded lawmakersтАЩ offices and both conservative and liberal ethics groups issued statements condemning the vote. Some Republicans joined in, saying the measure sent the wrong message to the public. (Internet searches for the words тАЬWho is my representativeтАЭ surged after news of the plan broke Monday night and peaked Tuesday morning, according to Google.) тАЬIt was a stumble,тАЭ said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina, who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of South Carolina. тАЬProbably not the way you want to start out. тАЭ Mr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts, suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics тАЬunfairтАЭ but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag тАЬDTS,тАЭ an apparent allusion to his promise to тАЬdrain the swampтАЭ in Washington. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy had made clear on Monday that they, too, were opposed to the change. But amid boxes of pizza at a House office building, with the Rose Bowl playing on a nearby television, several members voiced support for the maneuver, including Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico, whose office employed an aide who was ensnared in an ethics inquiry but later cleared. At first, on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy played down the changes. Mr. McCarthy suggested that he and Mr. Ryan did not have the power to simply order other Republicans to take their advice. тАЬWelcome back,тАЭ he joked, referring to the start of the new session of Congress on Tuesday. Even at home, he said, тАЬI usually donтАЩt win what we watch on TV. тАЭ About an hour later, before new members of Congress were to be sworn in  тАФ   the point when the House adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the   session  тАФ   Mr. McCarthy told his fellow Republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly, or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the House floor. By his estimation, he told them, the provision was going to be removed one way or another. This was not the first time that House lawmakers  тАФ   Democrats or Republicans  тАФ   had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics, which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations, even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right. Perhaps most prominently, in 2011, Representative Melvin Watt, a North Carolina Democrat who later left Congress to join the Obama administration, tried to cut the agencyтАЩs budget by 40 percent, a proposal that failed on a   vote. The House Ethics Committee, the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers, also frequently clashed with the office, which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds. For example, the committee tried in 2015 to force the Office of Congressional Ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine House lawmakersтАЩ trips to Azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for, in part, by a foreign government entity. Some of the lawmakers also accepted improper gifts during the trips, including rugs and crystal. The Office of Congressional Ethics refused to shut down its inquiry, and it published its findings on its own after the Ethics Committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing (although the committee urged them to return the gifts). House rules require the Ethics Committee to act on recommendations by the Office of Congressional Ethics within 90 days, with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated. But in recent years, the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case, a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009. Most frequently, that means an end to the matter, at least as far as the public is aware, even though the Ethics Committee never formally announces that it has closed the investigation. As of this week, cases in such a limbo include allegations against Representatives Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina Roger Williams, Republican of Texas Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois and Luis V. Guti├йrrez, Democrat of Illinois. After their reversal on Tuesday, House Republicans agreed to ask the Ethics Committee to examine the Office of Congressional Ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised. Mr. Goodlatte, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate. тАЬGross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda, resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment,тАЭ he said in a statement. But Mr. GoodlatteтАЩs critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers. тАЬWeтАЩre glad that the House Republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it, and not end real ethics enforcement in Congress,тАЭ Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said.
41	 (Want to get this briefing by email? HereтАЩs the  .) Good morning. HereтАЩs what you need to know: тАв Congress focuses on health care. Debate begins today on legislation to dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is scheduled to meet with Democrats about resisting efforts to repeal the law, while Vice   Mike Pence will meet with lawmakers from his party to gird them for a fight. тАв Rough first day back. Republican lawmakers abandoned on Monday a move to eliminate an ethics office after rebukes from constituents and from   Donald J. Trump. Our writer says Mr. TrumpтАЩs intervention raises тАЬalarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. тАЭ тАв Trump on trade. The  тАЩs pick for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, is a longtime advocate of protectionist policies, a choice in line with Mr. TrumpтАЩs focus on making products in America. That effort has made some Republicans uneasy, but some Democrats are ready to support it. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump criticized General Motors for making cars in Mexico. Hours later, Ford said it would expand production at a Michigan factory and would drop plans for a new plant in Mexico. тАв Getting ready for legal fights.  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired the former U. S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal fights against the White House. The state is preparing for battles on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. тАв Latest in Istanbul attack. Turkish officials say they know who killed at least 39 people in an assault on a nightclub last weekend, although they did not release his name. A video appears to show the suspect recording himself as he walked through the city. тАв Challenges ahead for Netanyahu. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been тАЬthe ultimate survivorтАЭ in a political system that destroyed many of his predecessors, our writers say, but the current graft inquiry could be different. The political turmoil comes as an Israeli soldier was found guilty of manslaughter today for shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker. The country has been highly divided over the case. тАв Rethinking death. One of our most popular stories this week is about Dr. B. J. Miller, who became a triple amputee after a horrific accident in college. HeтАЩs on a quest to change the way we die, and he pioneered a model of palliative care that aims to view death as a human experience, not just a medical one. тАв Megyn KellyтАЩs move to NBC from Fox News heralds a major shift in the cable news landscape, and it will give her a daytime show as well as a Sunday newsmagazine. Some industry executives outlined the challenges Ms. Kelly will face in those formats. тАв India has become a major center for cyberfraud, as a result of an abundance of young workers skilled in computers and English. A recent scheme targeting Indian immigrants in the U. S. came to light when two teenage workers blew the whistle. тАв The price of Bitcoin is soaring, thanks in part to a tilt toward isolationism in the U. S. and Europe, and to trading by Chinese speculators. The virtual currency is worth about $1, 025, or 140 percent more than a year ago. тАв U. S. stocks were up on Tuesday. HereтАЩs a snapshot of global markets. тАв Welcome to Hell   тАж     Hell, Mich. Our 360 video follows John Colone, the unofficial mayor of the town, which has a population of 72. тАв New to read. We review Aravind AdigaтАЩs new novel, тАЬSelection Day,тАЭ about religion and cricket. Mr. Adiga тАЬsupplies further proof that his Booker Prize, won for тАШThe White TigerтАЩ in 2008, was no fluke,тАЭ our critic writes. Also, we look at Roxane GayтАЩs new collection of short stories, тАЬDifficult Women. тАЭ тАв Alternate theory about the Titanic. An Irish journalist who spent 30 years investigating the famous sinking says he found evidence that a coal fire in the shipтАЩs hull weeks before it set sail played a role in the tragedy. тАЬItтАЩs a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence,тАЭ he said. тАв Recipe of the day. If youтАЩre going meatless to start the new year, try this spinach lasagna. While it bakes, read about Ruby Tandoh, the popular British cookbook author who urges us simply to eat what we love. This month, Melania Trump  тАФ   born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia  тАФ   will become the second first lady to have been born outside the U. S. Louisa Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829) was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English, her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors, including the future president, who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U. S. in 1801, when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted, her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas, and her soirees were the heart of WashingtonтАЩs social life when her husband was secretary of state, proving to be crucial to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her тАЬAmericannessтАЭ became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to defend herself only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be a political partner to her husband as he served in Congress after leaving the White House, supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852, both Houses adjourned. A Washington publication wrote that hers was one of the тАЬlongest funeral processions ever witnessed in this city. тАЭ Adeel Hassan contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

42	WASHINGTON  тАФ   The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday, as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President ObamaтАЩs signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office. On a day usually reserved for pomp, constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses, Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles. Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won   but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office, only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from   Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities. It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House. There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump, who ran against the Republican establishment, would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times. As Democrats in both chambers seethed, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring, even if any replacement of the law could take years. Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law. Under arcane budget procedures, that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority. And debate will begin on Wednesday, before senators have even moved into their new offices. The dueling over the health lawтАЩs fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal, and Mike Pence, the vice   will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead. While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises, the House got off to a messy start, brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. RyanтАЩs wishes. That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls. тАЬEvery   organization is calling my office,тАЭ said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. тАЬAnd weтАЩve told them: тАШThank you very much. We appreciate your feedback. тАЩтАЭ After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans, the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote. As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters, the House kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over Mr. Ryan, but he tried to brush it off. тАЬThereтАЩs no sense of foreboding in the House today,тАЭ Mr. Ryan said after his   тАЬonly the sense of potential. тАЭ The fight over the House rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose $2, 500 in fines for filming events on the House floor, a response to Democrats who streamed their overnight   over guns last June using cellphones and video cameras. In the Senate, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year, their colleagues looking on cheerfully, as a cold rain pelted the newly refurbished Capitol dome. Members of the House and Senate brought along their families  тАФ   elderly parents with canes, small children tugging at uncomfortable lacy hems  тАФ   as well as former senators and other special guests. Former Vice President Dick Cheney accompanied his daughter Liz to her   as a member of the House elected from Wyoming. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York officially became the Democratic leader and quickly warned Republicans that the minority would be vocal, if not operatic, in resisting much of their agenda and many of Mr. TrumpтАЩs nominees. тАЬIt is our job to do whatтАЩs best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there,тАЭ he said. тАЬIf the   proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure, trade and closing the carried interest loophole, for instance, we will work in good faith to perfect and, potentially, enact it. When he doesnтАЩt, we will resist. тАЭ He added, тАЬIf   Trump lets the   members of Congress and his cabinet run the show, if he adopts their timeworn policies  тАФ   which benefit the elites, the special interests and corporate America, not the working man and woman  тАФ   his presidency will not succeed. тАЭ On Tuesday, the House also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law. The budget blueprint introduced on Tuesday in the Senate is not sent to the president and does not become law, but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that Republicans say will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans bypassed the Budget Committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor. Such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the Budget Committee. Under the plan, four congressional committees  тАФ   two in the House and two in the Senate  тАФ   have until Jan. 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law. The document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved. Nor does it specify or even suggest how Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act, which the Obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured. Republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill, to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for Republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law. The budget blueprint allows Republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future, unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage. тАЬAmericans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles,тАЭ said Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. тАЬInsurers are withdrawing from markets across the country, leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before  тАФ   the opposite of what the law promised. тАЭ The American Medical Association urged Congress on Tuesday to explain how it would replace the Affordable Care Act. тАЬBefore any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policy makers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies,тАЭ the chief executive of the association, Dr. James L. Madara, said in a letter to congressional leaders. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010, promised this week that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be тАЬan act of cowardice on the part of Republicans,тАЭ and that тАЬthey donтАЩt even have the votes to do itтАЭ because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to give Mr. TrumpтАЩs cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman, asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing, set for next week for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump has chosen as attorney general.
43	WASHINGTON  тАФ     Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners. Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing, criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later, Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock, Mich. The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced   ) to be the United StatesтАЩ trade representative nearly completes Mr. TrumpтАЩs selection of top economic advisers and, taken together with the  тАЩs running commentary on Twitter, underscores Mr. TrumpтАЩs focus on making things in America. That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. TrumpтАЩs views on trade as dangerously retrograde, even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda. Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth. But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump. Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . I. O. president, Richard Trumka, to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. тАЬWe wanted him to know that weтАЩll work with him on doing that,тАЭ Mr. Trumka said. тАЬI donтАЩt think he has enough Republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people. тАЭ Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade, including Mr. Lighthizer, share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own  . They argue that other countries are undermining AmericaтАЩs industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy. In picking Mr. Lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of WashingtonтАЩs top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate. тАЬHe will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,тАЭ Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the partyтАЩs longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold hearings on Mr. LighthizerтАЩs nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday. тАЬAs the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we canтАЩt afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for   products and services,тАЭ Mr. Hatch said in a statement. тАЬI look forward to a vigorous discussion of BobтАЩs trade philosophy and priorities. тАЭ Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade, leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The   named the economist Peter Navarro, an outspoken critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary, will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer, however, is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. тАЬThose who say U. S. T. R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken,тАЭ said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industryтАЩs   on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. LighthizerтАЩs encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. тАЬHeтАЩll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro. тАЭ There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers, which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mr. TrumpтАЩs choice for ambassador to China. Proponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence. тАЬYouтАЩre seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law,тАЭ said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White  Case. тАЬBut that doesnтАЩt necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement. тАЭ Trade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of   policy. тАЬThereтАЩs going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and weтАЩre hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker,тАЭ Mr. Trumka said. Mr. TrumpтАЩs promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administrationтАЩs intentions. Economists see no evidence China is suppressing the value of its currency, although it has done so in the past. Mr. Lincicome said officially labeling China a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues. A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation. Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn. тАЬGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border,тАЭ he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. тАЬMake in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!тАЭ General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving   production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States. FordтАЩs announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of   vehicles, including its   pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new   sport utility vehicle. тАЬWe are encouraged by the   policies that   Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,тАЭ said the companyтАЩs chief executive, Mark Fields. Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations. Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like China in recent years, as a threat to American prosperity. тАЬPresident ReaganтАЩs pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders,тАЭ Mr. Lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for embracing тАЬunbridledтАЭ free trade. Conservatives, he argued, тАЬalways understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class. тАЭ
44	тЦа   Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies, with Vice   Mike Pence backing him up. тЦа SheтАЩs hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post, as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval OfficeтАЩs top slots. тЦа The   finds something тАЬvery strangeтАЭ about his intelligence briefing on Friday  тАФ   even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. For the Republican Party, Mr. Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq, published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, fleeing charges of rape. But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of AmericaтАЩs intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. TrumpтАЩs biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary ClintonтАЩs campaign chairman, John Podesta. Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence  тАФ   with тАЬ100 percentтАЭ certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: тАЬOur source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties. тАЭ But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks. com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. AssangeтАЩs statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that тАЬterribleтАЭ information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich. tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the cityтАЩs   water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here, among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query  тАФ   for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The   appears to be getting a jump on the news. Vice   Mike Pence defended Mr. TrumpтАЩs Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administrationтАЩs icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump тАЬexpressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,тАЭ Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. TrumpтАЩs remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the   saying he would not be commenting on тАЬevery little tweet or Facebook post. тАЭ But he called Mr. Assange тАЬa sycophant for Russia,тАЭ who тАЬleaks, steals data and compromises national security. тАЭ Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. тАЬHopefully, heтАЩll get up to speed on whatтАЩs been happening and what Russia has or has not done,тАЭ he said. Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. TrumpтАЩs reality television show тАЬThe Apprentice,тАЭ was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the тАЬBridgegateтАЭ scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. TrumpтАЩs real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things. He named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. TrumpтАЩs incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a тАЬteam of doersтАЭ who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have тАЬanother strong female leaderтАЭ on the team in Ms. Walsh. First, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New YearтАЩs Eve, the   promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now, he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that, in fact, intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the   has taken a swipe at the intelligence community, which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Vice   Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. тАЬThe first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,тАЭ Mr. Pence said. тАЬIt needs to be done. тАЭ And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter, trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with   health problems. тАЬSchumer clownsтАЭ may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new minority leader, but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. тАЬRepublicans should stop clowning around with AmericansтАЩ Medicare, Medicaid and health care,тАЭ Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would тАЬthrow the entire health care system into chaos. тАЭ Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, tried to coin a phrase: тАЬMake America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?тАЭ The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27, when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that тАЬmany peopleтАЭ saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino, Calif. attackersтАЩ home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did, after all, win the election. But he says he will hold a true, open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month, then canceled, to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation.
45	LOS ANGELES  тАФ   Girding for four years of potential battles with   Donald J. Trump, Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama, to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder, who is now a prominent Washington lawyer, is the latest sign of  the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here. тАЬHaving the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California,тАЭ Kevin de Le├│n, the Democratic leader of the Senate, said in an interview. тАЬThis means we are very, very serious. тАЭ Mr. de Le├│n said he expected California to challenge Washington  тАФ   and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington  тАФ   on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency. тАЬIt was very clear that it wasnтАЩt just campaign rhetoric,тАЭ Mr. de Le├│n said of Mr. TrumpтАЩs proposals over the past year. тАЬHe was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California. тАЭ Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment. The move by Mr. de Le├│n and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly, Anthony Rendon, follows Gov. Jerry BrownтАЩs appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month, to succeed Kamala D. Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate. That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the   Latino officials in this state, and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants. Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle. The Democratic Party controls   of both the Assembly and the Senate in California. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat. Mr. Holder was Mr. ObamaтАЩs attorney general from 2009 to 2015. He was the first   to hold that position. He is a partner at Covington  Burling, a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government. тАЬI am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact CaliforniaтАЩs residents and policy priorities,тАЭ Mr. Holder said in a statement. тАЬI am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. тАЭ The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff, but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years. Mr. de Le├│n said the final compensation for the firm had not been set, but would be publicly disclosed once it was. тАЬThe cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesnтАЩt adequately make its case,тАЭ he said.
46	JERUSALEM  тАФ   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis, the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground, they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March, the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of IsraelтАЩs occupation of the West Bank approaching, the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. тАЬThis is a difficult and painful day for us all,тАЭ Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon, which can be granted by IsraelтАЩs president or the armyтАЩs top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces, he added, тАЬThe soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters, and they need to remain above any dispute. тАЭ Prof. David Enoch, an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he thought the manslaughter conviction was тАЬjustifiedтАЭ but added, тАЬIтАЩm not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. тАЭ The militaryтАЩs rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once the threat is neutralized, they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger, particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing, caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide, for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force, and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel, a country where military service is a part of national identity, many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal, since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. IsraelтАЩs defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, called WednesdayтАЩs decision тАЬa tough verdict. тАЭ тАЬThe first thing I ask of all of us  тАФ   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  тАФ   we are all obligated to respect the courtтАЩs decision,тАЭ Mr. Lieberman said. тАЬWe are obligated to maintain restraint. тАЭ Mr. Lieberman, as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment, had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a тАЬtheater of the absurd. тАЭ But on Wednesday, he said, тАЬWe must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. тАЭ Politicians to Mr. NetanyahuтАЩs right and left have also called for a pardon, including the education minister, Naftali Bennett, and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party, who said that тАЬAzariaтАЩs shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissureтАЭ the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago, after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men, women and children as they returned from work in the fields, unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a тАЬpatently illegal orderтАЭ that carries a тАЬblack flagтАЭ of criminality. It helped shape the armyтАЩs ethos. Now, some fear that in the lower ranks, it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions, the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the militaryтАЩs headquarters in Tel Aviv, rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held, to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause, and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound, shouting slogans like тАЬfree the boy. тАЭ Col. Maya Heller, one of the military judges, spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been тАЬno justificationтАЭ for the shooting, according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant AzariaтАЩs telling of the event as тАЬtwistingтАЭ and тАЬevolving,тАЭ the judge said the defense had tried to тАЬhold the rope at both ends. тАЭ On one hand it asserted that the victim, Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving, and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria, a medic who was 19 at the time, made at the scene, indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting, Sergeant Azaria had said, тАЬHow is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?тАЭ After the shooting, a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying, тАЬThe terrorist deserved to die. тАЭ Ilan Katz, one of Sergeant AzariaтАЩs lawyers, vowed to appeal. The militaryтАЩs high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened, calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks, many   politicians and celebrities, along with Jewish parents of soldiers, hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant AzariaтАЩs actions, then phoned the soldierтАЩs family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant AzariaтАЩs distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism, and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service, his supporters portrayed him as тАЬeverybodyтАЩs child. тАЭ In remarks recorded before the verdict, the militaryтАЩs chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, tried to puncture that narrative. тАЬAn    in the Israeli Army is not тАШeverybodyтАЩs child,тАЩтАЭ he said. тАЬHe is a fighter, a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. тАЭ The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other, Mr. Sharif, 21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack, he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades, in the belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial, Sergeant AzariaтАЩs company commander, Maj. Tom Naaman, said he тАЬdid not feel any dangerтАЭ from Mr. Sharif, undercutting the defendantтАЩs claims. Yusri   Mr. SharifтАЩs father, told reporters that the verdict was тАЬa good stepтАЭ but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. тАЬFifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria,тАЭ Mr. Tibi wrote.
47	Stuck at your work desk? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood, combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention, and even dull hunger pangs, according to an instructive new study. The study, which also found that frequent, brief walking breaks were more effective at improving   than a single, longer walk before work, could provide the basis for a simple, realistic New YearтАЩs exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day. There is growing evidence, of course, that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences. Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs, increasing the risk for atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques in the arteries. People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily, which for many of us describes a typical workday, also are at heightened risk for diabetes, depression and obesity compared with people who move more often. In response, researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work, including standing workstations and treadmill desks. But such options are cumbersome and costly, making them impractical for many work situations. Some experts have worried, too, that if people are physically active at the office, they might subsequently become more tired, grumpy, distracted or hungry, any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and   health. So for the new study, which was published in November in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers. (The study was funded largely by Johnson  Johnson, with additional support from the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center.) To start, the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires. The researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank, on a numerical scale, how energetic or tired they felt, as well as how happy they were, and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then. The volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions. Then, on three subsequent visits to the clinic, each volunteer simulated a   workday. During one visit, the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions, except for bathroom breaks. During another, they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day, and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks. Finally, during a third visit, the volunteers sat for most of the six hours, but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking, using treadmills at the clinic. At the start and end of each session, the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones. And periodically throughout each day, they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods, energy, fatigue and appetites. The volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session. The researchers then analyzed the data. The numbers showed that on almost all measures, the subjectsтАЩ ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours. They said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active, whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks. On other measures, though, the   walks were more potent than the concentrated   version. When the workers rose most often, they reported greater happiness, less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days. Their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day, while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning. There were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests, whether they sat all day or got up and moved. Stress hormones also remained steady during each visit. These results suggest that тАЬeven a little bit of activity, spread throughout the day, is a practical, easy way to improve тАЭ says Jack Groppel, a study author and a founder of the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute. He points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry, but instead had the opposite effect. They also did not alter peopleтАЩs ability to focus, so, in theory, should not affect productivity (for good or ill). This study, however, was small in scale,   and limited by its dependence on the volunteersтАЩ perceptions of their responses to the experiment. But even so, тАЬitтАЩs clear that moving matters,тАЭ Dr. Groppel says. So set your 2017 appointment calendar, he suggests, to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity, whether you walk up and down a staircase, along a corridor or just pace around your office.
149	ISTANBUL  тАФ   An Islamic State disciple kills 39 New YearтАЩs revelers at an Istanbul nightclub. A gunman with a police badge assassinates RussiaтАЩs ambassador at an Ankara reception. Kurdish separatist bombers kill 14 soldiers on a bus in central Turkey and dozens of police officers at an Istanbul soccer match. Those assaults were just in the last few weeks, which made a car bombing on Thursday in the city of Izmir, where at least two civilians were killed, seem relatively minor. The 75 million people of Turkey, the NATO member and European Union aspirant that straddles Europe and Asia and was once seen as a stable democracy, are facing a ferocious onslaught of terrorist attacks unlike anything that has been seen in the West. Add to that the tumult from roughly three million Syrian war refugees, a resurgent Kurdish insurgency and a failed military coup  тАФ   all tied, in the eyes of many Turks, to American negligence, or malice, or both. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has responded with a furious crackdown on an array of perceived enemies, including the news media, and has lashed out at what he regards as Western complicity. While Mr. ErdoganтАЩs critics have denounced what they see as a bald usurpation of power that has subverted democracy and polarized the country, many Turks, frightened and uncertain, are not complaining. They view his authoritarianism as reassuring and angrily reject outsider comments about paranoia and conspiracy theories. Some are even embracing the advent of   Donald J. Trump, despite his   statements, viewing him as a decisive strongman sympathetic to Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist with little tolerance for those who dispute him. In some ways, political historians and scholars say, what is happening in Turkey parallels the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the 2015 attacks in France and, most recently, the response to attacks in Germany. In all of them, many citizens were willing to overlook or forsake civil liberties, government powers grew, fringe groups strengthened and spread intolerance, and dissent was regarded with suspicion. тАЬI think there are a lot of similar tendencies, and it leads to, in an extreme case, what weтАЩre seeing in Turkey,тАЭ said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle East and African Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. Still, Mr. Cook said, тАЬItтАЩs not that far a leap to go to an extreme  тАФ   can you imagine if the attacks in Turkey had happened in the United States?тАЭ On Friday, Hilal Kaplan, a columnist for Daily Sabah, a newspaper close to the government, lashed out at Western news coverage, including an article in The New York Times, that has emphasized conspiracy theories coursing through Turkish society that the United States is behind terrorism in Turkey. Describing the article as тАЬan attempt to condescend and affront rather than reflecting an effort to understand Turkey,тАЭ Ms. Kaplan said that Turks have good reason to be suspicious of the United States. She pointed out that Fethullah Gulen, the cleric and former Erdogan ally who many Turks believe was behind the coup attempt, lives in Pennsylvania, and that a former C. I. A. official had once vouched for Mr. Gulen on his green card application. In addition, she called attention to something else: The United States has provided military support to a Syrian Kurdish militia fighting Islamic State extremists, a militia that Turkey considers an ally of the P. K. K. the outlawed Kurdish separatist organization regarded as a terrorist enemy. In her Friday column, headlined тАЬWhy Turkey is looking forward to Trump administration,тАЭ she added, тАЬdo they really need such details if their only wish is to represent the Turkish people as paranoid and Erdogan as a villain?тАЭ In another parallel to    America, the Turkish government has aggressively exploited tragic events to stoke patriotic feelings and to frame the broader struggle within the country as a fight to secure democracy, even if democratic practices are eroded to do so. The comparison was not lost on Turkish scholars, even those critical of Mr. Erdogan, who were in the United States when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. тАЬI couldnтАЩt believe the extent to which there was a rise in nationalism, even among academics,тАЭ said Kemal Kirisci, a senior fellow and director of The Turkey Project at the Brookings Institution, recalling his own memories of living in America. тАЬI felt intimidated intellectually, almost felt censured. тАЭ After the coup attempt, the government moved quickly to memorialize victims and places rived by violence, renaming a bridge in Istanbul and a square in Ankara, and changing street names to honor citizens who died defending Mr. ErdoganтАЩs government. At yearтАЩs end, the prime ministerтАЩs office delivered packages to foreign correspondents in Turkey. Inside a black velvet box, with a silver clasp, was a small marble chunk, described as rubble from the Parliament building in Ankara, retrieved after an attack was carried out during the coup attempt. A note said that the rock тАЬis presented to you as a symbol of TurkeyтАЩs devotion to democracy. тАЭ And like American leaders who exhort citizens to maintain daily routines after terrorist attacks, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, urged Turks this week to carry on. тАЬOur citizens should not change the flow of their normal lives,тАЭ Mr. Yildirim said in a speech. тАЬIf they do, it will be serving the purposes of the terror group. тАЭ Mr. Erdogan and his allies see a double standard in the WestтАЩs reaction to Turkey, and say that some of the same measures Turkey is taking to combat terrorism, like resorting to emergency rule, have been embraced in the West, particularly in France. It is this disconnect  тАФ   between how Turkey perceives its own experience and the WestтАЩs reaction to events in Turkey  тАФ   that has contributed to Turkey pulling away from its NATO allies, and moving closer to Russia. тАЬIn France there is emergency rule for three months, and again for three months, and lately for six months, in total for a year,тАЭ Mr. Erdogan said in September. тАЬIs anyone from around the world asking France, тАШwhy did you declare emergency rule for a year? тАЩтАЭ Mr. Erdogan emphasized that the violence Turkey has faced is far greater than in countries like France. тАЬMy brothers, Turkey was the scene of terror incidents so heavy that they cannot be compared with France, and more importantly we faced a coup attempt,тАЭ he said. тАЬFrom this perspective I believe my country will understand the extension of emergency rule, and support it. тАЭ In a speech on Friday, Mr. Erdogan underscored the deep traumas Turkey has suffered in recent years. тАЬI do not believe any other country exists that went on its way standing upright after living with what we have gone through since 2013,тАЭ Mr. Erdogan said. тАЬWe became a unique example in history. We showed democracy can be protected together with security challenges. тАЭ Mr. ErdoganтАЩs supporters say they are especially upset over how the West has reacted to TurkeyтАЩs response to terrorism, saying they had expected solidarity, not criticism. тАЬThis is an obvious, very serious and problematic disrespect against TurkeyтАЩs right to defend itself against terror,тАЭ said Mustafa Yeneroglu, a member of Parliament with Mr. ErdoganтАЩs Islamist Justice and Development Party. Mr. Yeneroglu, the head of ParliamentтАЩs human rights committee, said Turkey faced the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. тАЬIf there is no security, there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,тАЭ he said. тАЬThis situation leads to prioritizing security while answering questions, тАШsecurity or liberty?тАЩ This is not only valid for Turkey but for all other liberal democracies. тАЭ Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that TurkeyтАЩs broad crackdown  тАФ   in putting so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  тАФ   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. тАЬOn the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,тАЭ said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, тАЬthere is emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on this scale. тАЭ Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the attempted coup, put it this way: тАЬYes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this coup dтАЩ├йtat attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150 journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. тАЭ Marc Pierini, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically, compromised the countryтАЩs ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the governmentтАЩs contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. тАЬAs weтАЩve seen after the coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  тАФ   so there is no limit,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhen you start pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And thatтАЩs where we stand. тАЭ
366	In his successful runs for state senator in Montana and then for Congress, Representative Ryan Zinke has promoted his   career in the Navy SEALs as one of his main credentials, going so far as to put the SEALsтАЩ Trident symbol on his campaign bus. While he has portrayed his accomplishments in the Navy in glowing terms, Mr. Zinke, a Republican and   Donald J. TrumpтАЩs nominee for secretary of the interior, has acknowledged one тАЬglitchтАЭ: that he improperly billed the government for travel to his home in Montana when he was a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the late 1990s. He had to repay $211 for one of two trips, he has said, maintaining that the episode did not derail what he described as a тАЬbrilliantтАЭ career. But two retired admirals under whom Mr. Zinke served say his account understates the damage that it did. Mr. Zinke was in fact punished for abusing his travel expenses, they say, through an evaluation that prevented him from rising to senior levels in the Navy. His former commanding officer in SEAL Team 6, retired Vice Adm. Albert M. Calland III, who had never before discussed the matter publicly, said in an interview that it was тАЬan easy decisionтАЭ to hit Mr. Zinke hard over the travel claims, which came at a time when he was supposed to help prevent such abuses. тАЬI gave him a fitness report that I thought would not allow him to get to captain, and that seemed, in that regard, to work O. K.,тАЭ Admiral Calland said. Even though Mr. Zinke served in a succession of No. 2 jobs in special operations after that, тАЬhe never got command,тАЭ the admiral said. Another retired vice admiral, Sean A. Pybus, who was Mr. ZinkeтАЩs boss after he left SEAL Team 6, said that Admiral CallandтАЩs decision to cite Mr. Zinke for тАЬlapses in judgmentтАЭ in failing to set a proper example was a red flag for boards screening officers for coveted command jobs. Even if a fitness report  тАФ   essentially a performance evaluation  тАФ   gives top marks in other areas, as Mr. ZinkeтАЩs did, тАЬlanguage there like тАШhey, this officer has questionable judgment,тАЩ that would keep him from being selected for a command position,тАЭ Admiral Pybus said. тАЬAnd I think thatтАЩs exactly what happened. тАЭ Mr. Zinke has said he took the trips to scout training locations in Montana and nearby parts of Washington and took leave while he was there to do construction work on a family home in Whitefish, Mont. But officials who were at the command said he had less reason to scout sites at the time because he was finishing a   tour as an assault team leader. They said one of the trips also seemed suspicious because he had sought reimbursement for excess airline baggage even though he was traveling alone. Admiral Calland recalled that there was тАЬa lot of discussionтАЭ among senior officers about how to punish him. It also hurt Mr. Zinke, the officials said, that the trips came when SEAL Team 6  тАФ   which, though now best known for killing Osama bin Laden, had initially been filled with   mavericks who flouted the rules  тАФ   wanted to project a more professional image to compete with the ArmyтАЩs Delta Force for top missions. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump said that Mr. Zinke, 55, was preparing for a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday and that neither he nor the transition team would comment for this article. Mr. ZinkeтАЩs supporters say he has long since transcended the old problems through his political work and by becoming the first SEAL team member to be nominated for a cabinet position. Mr. Zinke, who was born and raised in Montana, was elected to the State Senate shortly after he retired from the Navy in 2008. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014 and won his second term in Congress in November with 57 percent of the vote. While the main focus of the hearing is likely to be his support for increasing energy drilling and mining on public lands, and his stated view that climate change is тАЬnot proven science,тАЭ senators could also question him about his Navy career. There is no doubt that Mr. Zinke was well liked and a rising star in the SEALs before the travel expenses episode. When he was a lieutenant commander in early 1998, his team snatched a Bosnian Serb war criminal, Goran Jelisic, on a city street and hustled him away in a van in a daring daytime operation. Even after Admiral Calland gave him declining performance marks in military bearing and leadership over the travel issues in   Mr. Zinke was promoted to the rank of commander, which is equivalent to lieutenant colonel in the Army, Air Force and Marines. But while he would have been eligible two or three times before he retired to be placed in charge of a unit as a commanding officer, he never was. And without serving as a commanding officer, he could not become a captain, which is equivalent to a colonel in the other services, and then an admiral, as some of his SEAL peers have. Kenneth Stethem, a retired SEAL chief petty officer who supports Mr. Zinke, said the travel issue seemed minor so many years later. тАЬWe have a saying in the teams: тАШYou never shoot a   man with a   bullet,тАЩ and thatтАЩs exactly whatтАЩs going on right here,тАЭ he said. But some former SEAL team members claim that Mr. Zinke has also exploited his past  тАФ   he placed the SEALsтАЩ insignia (with six stars, presumably for SEAL Team 6) on his campaign bus in violation of Defense Department guidelines against politicizing such symbols  тАФ   and that he exaggerated what he did in his later military jobs to obscure that he never received commands of his own. He published an autobiography in November that was grandly titled тАЬAmerican Commander. тАЭ And his biography on his congressional website says that he was тАЬdeputy and acting commanderтАЭ of a task force тАЬwhere he led a force of over 3, 500 Special Operations personnel in IraqтАЭ in 2004. In an interview, Michael S. Repass, who retired from the Army as a major general and was Mr. ZinkeтАЩs boss in Iraq, chuckled and said, тАЬThat might be a stretch. тАЭ General Repass said that while Mr. Zinke was his deputy commander for four months, he had named him acting commander for only about a week and a half, when the general traveled to the United States. General Repass said Mr. Zinke тАЬdid a good jobтАЭ as his deputy and was тАЬa competent guy,тАЭ and he had nominated Mr. Zinke for one of two Bronze Stars he received. Admiral Pybus said that Mr. Zinke was тАЬembarrassed and humbledтАЭ when he left SEAL Team 6 and тАЬdid quite wellтАЭ as his deputy at a command using   SEAL units in Europe. тАЬI didnтАЩt see any fallback on poor judgment or indiscretions,тАЭ Admiral Pybus said, adding that he had heard Mr. Zinke also did well in another Navy job, as the   officer (and briefly acting commander) of the main SEAL training center. Mr. Zinke attended the University of Oregon on a football scholarship and graduated in 1984 with a geology degree. He served first at a regular SEAL team and then trained other SEAL team members. Records show that two of his early bosses believed that he had the potential to become an admiral. He joined SEAL Team 6 for a stint in 1991. After working on a staff in London, Mr. Zinke returned to SEAL Team 6 in 1996 as the leader of Gold Team, one of three assault teams. Mark Cochiolo, one of the enlisted team members, said Mr. Zinke fixed тАЬsome disciplinary issuesтАЭ and тАЬgot us refocused on what we were there for. тАЭ The high mark came on Jan. 22, 1998, when members of Mr. ZinkeтАЩs team jumped from unmarked vans and seized Mr. Jelisic, who had called himself the тАЬSerb Adolf,тАЭ after Hitler, as he killed detainees during the Bosnian war. The operation took only a minute, former team members say, and Mr. Jelisic ended up with a   prison sentence. Admiral Calland called Mr. Zinke a тАЬsuperstarтАЭ in his fitness report for that year and predicted that he would тАЬlead and command with distinction. тАЭ But in referring to the travel problems that hurt his next evaluation, Mr. Zinke surprised some of his former teammates by suggesting in his book that he was not aware that standards had tightened. He recalled how Team 6 members had earlier тАЬtraveled and trained where they liked and Navy oversight was little or none. тАЭ When he became the Gold Team leader, he maintained, тАЬthe command had changed, but I had not,тАЭ attributing his travel violations to either тАЬbad judgment or a bad habit. тАЭ He also minimized the effect the issue had on his career. While he wrote that it was тАЬa hard lesson to learn and likely put a cloud over me making flag officer,тАЭ or admiral, he referred to the episode as just a тАЬshot across the bow. тАЭ He also wrote that тАЬthe biggest penalty was being embarrassed for wrongdoing. тАЭ
367	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  тАФ   It was Nov. 12, and Bill Maher was about to begin his comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when he did something he hadnтАЩt done in many years. He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie (tequila). тАЬAnd boy did I miss it,тАЭ he joked with me last week. тАЬWhat an idiot all those years  тАФ   drinkingтАЩs fun. You hear that, kids? DrinkingтАЩs fun!тАЭ Actually, thatтАЩs not why he did it, he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking  тАФ   and, in his case, a wee bit of pot smoking  тАФ   that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge (oh, the indignities of this job). He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional. But that night, so soon after the election, he needed something to calm his nerves. Donald J. Trump, who Mr. Maher said тАЬlives for vengeance,тАЭ had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government, like the Justice Department, and, more to the point, the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that тАЬno oneтАЩs been meaner to him than me. тАЭ Mr. Maher has a unique perspective. He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion, dodging traffic from left and right. He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth. But first, a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a   totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his   ABC show, тАЬPolitically Incorrect. тАЭ He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldnтАЩt be called тАЬcowards,тАЭ especially when the United StatesтАЩ preferred method of attack at the time  тАФ   before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  тАФ   was to lob cruise missiles from afar (тАЬThatтАЩs cowardly,тАЭ he said). The White House criticized him, sponsors fled and, a few months later, ABC canceled his show. Whatever you might think of his argument, the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse. It could have been a   too, if HBO hadnтАЩt provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show, тАЬReal Time,тАЭ which has an audience of about 4. 5 million viewers. Yet, Mr. Maher puts that episode within тАЬthe normal parameters of awful. тАЭ He says heтАЩs more worried about our new era, when no one knows what тАЬnormalтАЭ is going to look like. ItтАЩs amazing how much anxiety Mr. TrumpтАЩs imminent inauguration is stirring in the   business  тАФ   but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press, his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him. No one knows whether a year from now, weтАЩll see todayтАЩs fears as overblown, underblown, or on point. Mr. Maher is taking the    approach based on his own experience in the Trumpian combat caldron in 2013. That was when Mr. Maher launched a тАЬbirtherтАЭ тАФ   or, тАЬ тАЭ  тАФ   campaign about Mr. Trump, to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President ObamaтАЩs citizenship. Appearing on тАЬThe Tonight Show,тАЩтАЩ he joked that Mr. Trump was the product of   crossbreeding it was the only thing, he said, that would explain the тАЬcolor of his hair. тАЭ He said he would donate $5 million to a charity of Mr. TrumpтАЩs choice if he could prove this wasnтАЩt the case. (Mr. Maher pledged $1 million in 2012 to a тАЬsuper PACтАЭ supporting Obama.) Mr. TrumpтАЩs lawyers replied with a copy of his   birth certificate and a demand for the money, which Mr. Maher ignored. Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere. тАЬIt was worth it in comedy material,тАЭ Mr. Maher told me, taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head (a gift from a friend) as we stood by the bar in his   living room. тАЬBut you definitely spent money. тАЭ That is, Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford. He takes it as a harbinger. тАЬNo one knows what this man is capable of,тАЭ Mr. Maher said. тАЬI never, ever, ever felt worried  тАФ   it never crossed my mind  тАФ   that George Bush would do something crazy, even though I knew he hated me. He never sued me for a joke. тАЭ Mr. Maher was particularly focused on reports that several F. B. I. agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton, which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump. (The Justice DepartmentтАЩs inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. тАЩs   performance.) тАЬIt is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized,тАЭ he said. тАЬWhen the internal police department is politicized, thatтАЩs a place I donтАЩt want to be on the wrong side of  тАФ   I mean, thatтАЩs fascism. тАЭ You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia, and itтАЩs quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism. But with so many sharing similar worries (at least among those who didnтАЩt support Mr. Trump) and with Mr. TrumpтАЩs continued cage rattling, I turned to Mr. TrumpтАЩs adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for a response. It seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of Mr. MaherтАЩs, dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the   trail on Comedy Central. Given Mr. TrumpтАЩs preference for Twitter, Ms. Conway joked, using the F. B. I. would be тАЬso last century  тАФ   itтАЩs so bureaucratic and paperwork laden. тАЭ Turning more serious, she said, тАЬHeтАЩs not going to use the тАШtools of state,тАЩтАЭ repeating the wording of my question. I noted that there are, of course, guidelines, professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a presidentтАЩs ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon, and she agreed, saying тАЬThis is America. тАЭ Ms. Conway acknowledged, though, that Mr. MaherтАЩs fears were widely held, especially in Hollywood  тАФ   witness Meryl StreepтАЩs Golden Globes address. тАЬTalk about a Hollywood story  тАФ   folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable,тАЭ she said. She described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by тАЬthe elitesтАЭ to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks. тАЬWhereтАЩs the respect  тАФ   open ear and open mind? тАЩтАЩ she said. тАЬThe same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets,тАЭ she said. It was time, she said, to тАЬtake the poison out of the pen and keyboard. тАЭ Mr. Maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day, Jan. 20 (his birthday, and Ms. ConwayтАЩs). But he shares Ms. ConwayтАЩs view of the cultural stakes in the election. тАЬWeтАЩre the losers now, so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more,тАЭ he said. Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. StreepтАЩs  тАФ   calling actors, screenwriters and the news media to arms  тАФ   werenтАЩt going to solve anything. тАЬIt looks very insular,тАЭ he said. тАЬJust the liberals talking to themselves, which they are very good at doing. тАЭ Still the bane of conservatives, Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism, for which he says liberals have too much tolerance. ThatтАЩs part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left. At the same time, his restaurant selection, the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel, came in defiance of a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. To join the boycott, Mr. Maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby, would be to submit to an ineffectual form of тАЬtokenism. тАЭ тАЬAs if the sultan of Brunei is up there looking at the receipts  тАФ   we only sold two soups? Is Stallone still coming in?тАЭ he said. тАЬBut Sultan, your harem awaits  тАФ   тАШIтАЩm sorry, IтАЩm still going over the receipts. тАЩтАЭ With that, we took our seats and the waiter approached. Surprised to see Mr. Maher, he asked тАЬYouтАЩre not in hiding?тАЭ That got Mr. Maher all worked up again. тАЬI can be scared,тАЭ he said, тАЬand never pull a punch. тАЭ
368	Michiko Kakutani, the chief book critic for The New York Times, interviewed President Obama about literature on Friday at the White House. Here are excerpts from the conversation, which have been edited and condensed.  These books that you gave to your daughter Malia on the Kindle, what were they? Some of your favorites? I think some of them were sort of the usual suspects, so тАЬThe Naked and the DeadтАЭ or тАЬOne Hundred Years of Solitude,тАЭ I think she hadnтАЩt read yet. Then there were some books I think that are not on everybodyтАЩs reading list these days, but I remembered as being interesting, like тАЬThe Golden NotebookтАЭ by Doris Lessing, for example. Or тАЬThe Woman Warrior,тАЭ by Maxine [Hong Kingston]. Part of what was interesting was me pulling back books that I thought were really powerful, but that might not surface when she goes to college. Have you had a chance to discuss them with her? IтАЩve had the chance to discuss some. And sheтАЩs interested in being a filmmaker, so storytelling is of great interest to her. She had just read тАЬA Moveable Feast. тАЭ I hadnтАЩt included that, and she was just captivated by the idea that Hemingway described his goal of writing one true thing every day. What made you want to become a writer? I loved reading when I was a kid, partly because I was traveling so much, and there were times where IтАЩd be displaced, IтАЩd be the outsider. When I first moved to Indonesia, IтАЩm this big,   kid that kind of stood out. And then when I moved back from Indonesia to Hawaii, I had the manners and habits probably of an Indonesian kid. And so the idea of having these worlds that were portable, that were yours, that you could enter into, was appealing to me. And then I became a teenager and wasnтАЩt reading that much other than what was assigned in school, and playing basketball and chasing girls, and imbibing things that werenтАЩt very healthy. I think all of us did. Yeah. And then I think rediscovered writing and reading and thinking in my first or second year of college and used that as a way to rebuild myself, a process I write about in тАЬDreams From My Father. тАЭ That  period in New York, where you were intensely reading. I was hermetic  тАФ   it really is true. I had one plate, one towel, and IтАЩd buy clothes from thrift shops. And I was very intense, and sort of humorless. But it reintroduced me to the power of words as a way to figure out who you are and what you think, and what you believe, and whatтАЩs important, and to sort through and interpret this swirl of events that is happening around you every minute. And so even though by the time I graduated I knew I wanted to be involved in public policy, or I had these vague notions of organizing, the idea of continuing to write and tell stories as part of that was valuable to me. And so I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two. The great thing was that it was useful in my organizing work. Because when I got there, the guy who had hired me said that the thing that brings people together to have the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issue, itтАЩs that they have shared stories. And he told me that if you learn how to listen to peopleтАЩs stories and can find whatтАЩs sacred in other peopleтАЩs stories, then youтАЩll be able to forge a relationship that lasts. But my interest in public service and politics then merged with the idea of storytelling. What were your short stories like? ItтАЩs interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people. I think part of the reason was because I was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me. We were going into churches, and probably the average age of these folks was 55, 60. A lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, but just barely. They were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay  тАФ   steel mills had closed, and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities. And so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment. And so a bunch of the short stories I wrote had to do with that sense, that atmosphere. One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and heтАЩs got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple  тАФ   a white couple in L. A.  тАФ   and heтАЩs like in advertising, wrote jingles. And heтАЩs just retired and has gotten cranky. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over. So when I think back on whatтАЩs interesting to me, there is not a lot of Jack Kerouac,   young kid on the make discovering stuff. ItтАЩs more melancholy and reflective. Was writing partly a way to figure out your identity? Yes, I think so. For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life  тАФ   race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. People now remark on this notion of me being very cool, or composed. And what is true is that I generally have a pretty good sense of place and who I am, and whatтАЩs important to me. And I trace a lot of that back to that process of writing. Has that continued to be so in the presidency? Not as much as I would have liked. I just didnтАЩt have time. But you keep some form of a journal? IтАЩve kept some, but not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for. The main writing that IтАЩve done during the presidency has been my speeches, the ones at least that were important to me. How has the speechwriting and  being at the center of history and dealing with crises affected you as a writer? IтАЩm not sure yet. IтАЩll have to see when I start writing the next book. Some of the craft of writing a good speech is identical to any other good writing: Is that word necessary? Is it the right word? Is there a rhythm to it that feels good? How does it sound aloud? I actually think that one of the useful things about speechwriting is reminding yourself that the original words are spoken, and that there is a sound, a feel to words that, even if youтАЩre reading silently, transmits itself. So in that sense, I think there will be some consistency. But this is part of why it was important to pick up the occasional novel during the presidency, because most of my reading every day was briefing books and memos and proposals. And so working that very analytical side of the brain all the time sometimes meant you lost track of not just the poetry of fiction, but also the depth of fiction. Fiction was useful as a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day and was a way of seeing and hearing the voices, the multitudes of this country. Are there examples of specific novels or writers? Well, the last novel I read was Colson WhiteheadтАЩs тАЬThe Underground Railroad. тАЭ And the reminder of the ways in which the pain of slavery transmits itself across generations, not just in overt ways, but how it changes minds and hearts. ItтАЩs what you said in your farewell address about Atticus Finch, where you said people are so isolated in their little bubbles. Fiction can leap  тАФ   It bridges them. I struck up a friendship with [the novelist] Marilynne Robinson, who has become a good friend. And weтАЩve become sort of pen pals. I started reading her in Iowa, where тАЬGileadтАЭ and some of her best novels are set. And I loved her writing in part because I saw those people every day. And the interior life she was describing that connected them  тАФ   the people I was shaking hands with and making speeches to  тАФ   it connected them with my grandparents, who were from Kansas and ended up journeying all the way to Hawaii, but whose foundation had been set in a very similar setting. And so I think that I found myself better able to imagine whatтАЩs going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency because of not just a specific novel but the act of reading fiction. It exercises those muscles, and I think that has been helpful. And then thereтАЩs been the occasion where I just want to get out of my own head. [Laughter] Sometimes you read fiction just because you want to be someplace else. What are some of those books? ItтАЩs interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things  тАФ   some science fiction. For a while, there was a     novel, the тАЬ  ProblemтАЭ series  тАФ   Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.  тАФ   which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting. It wasnтАЩt so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping  тАФ   ItтАЩs really about the fate of the universe. Exactly. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my    problems with Congress seem fairly petty  тАФ   not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade. [Laughter] There were books that would blend, I think, really good writing with thriller genres. I mean, I thought тАЬGone GirlтАЭ was a     book. I loved that structure. Yeah, and it was really well executed. And a similar structure, that I thought was a really powerful novel: тАЬFates and Furies,тАЭ by Lauren Groff. I like those structures  where you actually see different points of view. Which I have to do for this job, too. [Laughter] Have there been certain books that have been touchstones for you in these eight years? I would say Shakespeare continues to be a touchstone. Like most teenagers in high school, when we were assigned, I donтАЩt know, тАЬThe TempestтАЭ or something, I thought, тАШMy God, this is boring.тАЩ And I took this wonderful Shakespeare class in college where I just started to read the tragedies and dig into them. And that, I think, is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings. Is that sort of comforting? It gives me a sense of perspective. I think Toni MorrisonтАЩs writings  тАФ   particularly тАЬSong of SolomonтАЭ is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship. That itтАЩs not just pain, but thereтАЩs joy and glory and mystery. I think that there are writers who I donтАЩt necessarily agree with in terms of their politics, but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things  тАФ   V. S. Naipaul, for example. His тАЬA Bend in the River,тАЭ which starts with the line, тАЬThe world is what it is men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it. тАЭ And I always think about that line, and I think about his novels when IтАЩm thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true. So in that sense, IтАЩm using writing like that as a foil or something to debate against. IтАЩve read that Lincoln  loved Shakespeare his whole life, but  when he was dealing with the Civil War,  reading the  history plays helped give him solace and perspective. LincolnтАЩs own writings do that. He is a very fine writer. IтАЩd put the Second Inaugural up against any piece of American writing  тАФ   as good as anything. One of the great treats of being president is, in the Lincoln Bedroom, thereтАЩs a copy of the Gettysburg Address handwritten by him, one of five copies he did for charity. And there have been times in the evening when IтАЩd just walk over, because itтАЩs right next to my office, my home office, and I just read it. And perspective is exactly what is wanted. At a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted, the ability to slow down and get perspective, along with the ability to get in somebody elseтАЩs shoes  тАФ   those two things have been invaluable to me. Whether theyтАЩve made me a better president, I canтАЩt say. But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years, because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesnтАЩt let up. Is there some poem or any  writing or author that you would turn to, say,  after the mass killings in Newtown, Conn. or during the financial crisis? I think that during those periods, LincolnтАЩs writings, KingтАЩs writings, GandhiтАЩs writings, MandelaтАЩs writings  тАФ   I found those particularly helpful, because what you wanted was a sense of solidarity. During very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating. So sometimes you have to hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated. ChurchillтАЩs a good writer. And I loved reading Teddy RooseveltтАЩs writing. HeтАЩs this big, outsize character. Have you read a lot of presidential biographies?  The biographies have been useful, because I do think that thereтАЩs a tendency, understandable, to think that whateverтАЩs going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult. And it just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate World War II or Lincoln trying to figure out whether heтАЩs going to fire [George B.] McClellan when Rebel troops are 20, 30, 40 miles away. I watched some of the    documentary   тАЬEyes on the PrizeтАЭ after the election.  It was useful. You do see how far weтАЩve come, and in the space of my lifetime. And thatтАЩs why seeing my daughters now picking up books that I read 30 years ago or 40 years ago is gratifying, because I want them to have perspective  тАФ   not for purposes of complacency, but rather to give them confidence that people with a sense of determination and courage and pluck can reshape things. ItтАЩs empowering for them. What books would you recommend at this moment in time, that  captures this sense of turmoil? I should probably ask you or some people who have had time to catch up on reading. IтАЩll confess that since the election, IтАЩve been busier than I expected. So one of the things IтАЩm really looking forward to is to dig into a whole bunch of literature. But one of the things IтАЩm confident about is that, out of this moment, there are a whole bunch of writers, a lot of them young, who are probably writing the book I need to read. [Laughter] TheyтАЩre ahead of me right now. And so in my   in addition to training the next generation of leaders to work on issues like climate change or gun violence or criminal justice reform, my hope is to link them up with their peers who see fiction or nonfiction as an important part of that process. When so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify  тАФ   as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize  тАФ   is more important than ever. ThereтАЩs something particular about quieting yourself and having a sustained stretch of time that is different from music or television or even the greatest movies. And part of what weтАЩre all having to deal with right now is just a lot of information overload and a lack of time to process things. So we make quick judgments and assign stereotypes to things, block certain things out, because our brain is just trying to get through the day. WeтАЩre bombarded with information. Technology is moving so rapidly. Look, I donтАЩt worry about the survival of the novel. WeтАЩre a storytelling species. I think that what one of the jobs of political leaders going forward is, is to tell a better story about what binds us together as a people. And America is unique in having to stitch together all these disparate elements  тАФ   weтАЩre not one race, weтАЩre not one tribe, folks didnтАЩt all arrive here at the same time. What holds us together is an idea, and itтАЩs a story about who we are and whatтАЩs important to us. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I know you like Junot D├нazтАЩs and Jhumpa LahiriтАЩs books, and they speak to immigration or the American Dream. I think LahiriтАЩs books, I think D├нazтАЩs books, do speak to a very particular contemporary immigration experience. But also this combination of  тАФ   that I think is universal  тАФ   longing for this better place, but also feeling displaced and looking backwards at the same time. I think in that sense, their novels are directly connected to a lot of American literature. Some of the great books by Jewish authors like Philip Roth or Saul Bellow, they are steeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what youтАЩre giving up  тАФ   what youтАЩre willing to give up and what youтАЩre not willing to give up. So that particular aspect of American fiction I think is still of great relevance today.
369	The many men, women and children who spend their days glued to their smartphones and social media accounts might learn something from   Miranda, creator of the groundbreaking megahit тАЬHamilton. тАЭ Asked in an interview with Delta Sky magazine when and where he finds time to be creative, Mr. Miranda, an avid reader of books and enthusiast for unfettered downtime, replied: тАЬThe good idea comes in the moment of rest. It comes in the shower. It comes when youтАЩre doodling or playing trains with your son. тАШHamiltonтАЩ forced me to double down on being awake to the inspirations of just living my life. тАЭ Mr. MirandaтАЩs observation bodes ill for the future, not just of creativity but also of healthy bodies, minds and relationships. No doubt youтАЩve seen the following scenarios, probably many times: тАв Young couples out to dinner pull out their smartphones to check messages, emails and social networks even before scanning the menu, and check their phones repeatedly throughout the meal. тАв Shoppers and commuters standing in line, people crossing busy streets, even cyclists and drivers whose eyes are on their phones instead of their surroundings. тАв Toddlers in strollers playing with a digital device  тАФ   a parentтАЩs or perhaps even their own  тАФ   instead of observing and learning from the world around them. тАв People walking down the street with eyes on their phones, bumping into others, tripping over or crashing into obstacles. Observations like these have prompted a New York psychotherapist to ask, тАЬWhat really matters?тАЭ in life. In her enlightening new book, тАЬThe Power of Off,тАЭ Nancy Colier observes that тАЬwe are spending far too much of our time doing things that donтАЩt really matter to us. тАЭ Both in and outside her practice, she has encountered many people who have become тАЬdisconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings. тАЭ The   access to digital technology, starting at ever younger ages, is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health, neurological development and personal relationships, not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks. DonтАЩt get me wrong. IтАЩm no Luddite. I love technology. I love the convenience and assistance afforded by the myriad apps on my cellphone, a   information bank. I remember being amazed, as a Times reporter back in the early 1980s, when I started using word processing and realized how much faster I could write an article. Now computers save tons of time and effort and avert countless embarrassing errors because I can look up facts, figures, spelling, definitions and scholarly publications without leaving my ergonomic chair. But I also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog, meeting and chatting with friends, acquaintances and strangers, some of whom have become friends. As with so much else in life, moderation in our digital world should be the hallmark of a healthy relationship with technology. Too many of us have become slaves to the devices that were supposed to free us, giving us more time to experience life and the people we love. Instead, weтАЩre constantly bombarded by bells, buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately. тАЬMost people now check their smartphones 150 times per day, or every six minutes,тАЭ Ms. Colier wrote. тАЬAnd young adults are now sending an average of 110 texts per day. тАЭ Furthermore, she added, тАЬ46 percent of smartphone users now say that their devices are something they тАШcouldnтАЩt live without. тАЩтАЭ In тАЬThe World Unplugged Project,тАЭ investigators at the University of Maryland reported that тАЬa clear majorityтАЭ of students in the 10 countries studied experienced distress when they tried to go without their devices for 24 hours. One in three people admitted theyтАЩd rather give up sex than their smartphones. I fear we are turning into digital robots. Will future generations know how to converse with one another face to face? Will they notice the birds, trees, sunrise and the people with whom they share the planet? Instead of visiting art galleries, attending concerts or walking on picturesque wooded paths, one woman I know who came to Woodstock, N. Y. last summer spent the weekend on her iPad communing with her many тАЬfriendsтАЭ on Facebook. All I could think was тАЬWhat a waste!тАЭ Why, you may ask, is it so important to limit our digital lives? тАЬWithout open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down  тАФ   itтАЩs in constant    mode,тАЭ Ms. Colier said in an interview. тАЬWeтАЩre wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but weтАЩre not doing it. тАЭ She continued, тАЬItтАЩs connections to other human beings  тАФ     connections, not digital ones  тАФ   that nourish us and make us feel like we count. Our presence, our full attention is the most important thing we can give each other. Digital communications donтАЩt result in deeper connections, in feeling loved and supported. тАЭ How often is your real work interrupted by signals from your smartphone that you find impossible to ignore? Have you ever avoided intimacy with your partner because youтАЩre in the midst of iPhone Scrabble? Is endlessly snapping selfies and posting your every action and thought on social media creating an unhealthy  ? As for physical   every hour spent on a device is likely to be an indoor, sedentary one. Screens are stealing time that children and adolescents should be spending on physical activity and sports, reading, or creating and engaging directly with other children, all of which are critical to healthy physical and social development. тАЬChildren who overuse online media are at risk of problematic internet use, and heavy users of video games are at risk of internet gaming disorderтАЭ (translation: addiction) the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in its latest policy statement on media use. Ms. Colier, a licensed clinical social worker, said, тАЬThe only difference between digital addiction and other addictions is that this is a socially condoned behavior. тАЭ While her book contains a   digital detox program, in our interview she offered three steps to help curb oneтАЩs digital dependence. 1. Start by recognizing how much digital use is really needed, say, for work or navigation or letting family members know youтАЩre O. K. and what is merely a habit of responding, posting and  . 2. Make little changes. Refrain from using your device while eating or spending time with friends, and add one thing a day thatтАЩs done without the phone. 3. Become very conscious of what is important to you, what really nourishes you, and devote more time and attention to it.
474	In an interview with CNN on Wednesday night, Thomas Barrack Jr. who heads the Presidential Inaugural Committee, was asked whether Kanye West, who vocally supported Donald J. TrumpтАЩs candidacy last year, and who visited him in Trump Tower in December following his victory, would be performing at any of the inaugural events. тАЬWe havenтАЩt asked him,тАЭ Mr. Barrack replied. Rather than stop there, he continued: тАЬItтАЩs not the venue. The venue we have for entertainment is filled out. ItтАЩs perfect. ItтАЩs going to be typically and traditionally American. тАЭ Following a political season in which quarrels over inclusion and exclusion in the United States  тАФ   in senses literal, metaphorical and philosophical  тАФ   were central and heated, the тАЬMake America Great Again! Welcome CelebrationтАЭ was an opportunity to make a loud case. The stage was a potent one: the National Mall in Washington, just beneath the Lincoln Memorial. The concert was broadcast live on CNN and online. What was presented as тАЬtypically and traditionally American,тАЭ however, veered between jingoism and vaudevillian fluff and largely ignored the contribution of   to popular music (which is to say, almost all of popular music). Instead it focused heavily on country and rock by white Southerners, including the country superstar Toby Keith, who has been the nationтАЩs loudest musical cheerleader for a decade and a half the Mississippi   band 3 Doors Down, which was a favorite in the    2000s and the Frontmen of Country, an amalgam of   singers made famous in other bands. It was a spotty lineup, though not a wholly ineffective one. 3 Doors DownтАЩs songs remain sturdy, and the frontman Brad ArnoldтАЩs voice was strong, though denuded of its sleazy edges. And Mr. Keith, the headliner, in a heavy overcoat and a scruffy beard, delivered potent patriotism via strong narratives. Mr. Keith isnтАЩt as uncomplicated a choice as he might appear from a distance. In the past, heтАЩs been a registered Democrat, and here, he thanked President Obama for his service before offering a salute to Mr. Trump. Mr. KeithтАЩs career soared after   when his music took an aggressive turn. At this show, he played the pugnacious and proud тАЬCourtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American),тАЭ and also тАЬAmerican Soldier,тАЭ a meditative embrace of patriotic dedication. He also played тАЬBeer for My Horses,тАЭ with its    endorsement of   vigilante justice: тАЬTake all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak   up all them bad boys, hang them high in the   all the people to see. тАЭ Mr. KeithтАЩs songs about America are very conscious of place, and at this show, that proved an effective strategy. The Frontmen of Country leaned heavily on songs that mentioned bucolic Southern settings: тАЬGod Blessed Texas,тАЭ тАЬAmyтАЩs Back in Austin,тАЭ тАЬWalking in Memphis. тАЭ And Lee Greenwood joined them for тАЬGod Bless the U. S. A. ,тАЭ a dour march of national pride. In total, the concertтАЩs message was that America is a defined geographical and ideological space, with borders worth defending, even at the price of excluding those who could make the place immeasurably more fun. This concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did. The only featured nonwhite performers were Sam Moore (of the 1960s soul duo Sam  Dave) who sang a restrained тАЬAmerica the BeautifulтАЭ backed by an   choir, and DJ Ravidrums, who delivered his dim, caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical   drum kit. But both of those acts got just a couple of minutes. The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps got much more time for their    songs. When Mr. Trump first appeared onstage at the show, accompanied by his wife, Melania, it was to the Rolling StonesтАЩs тАЬHeart of Stone,тАЭ a song about a man who canтАЩt be swayed. At the end of the concert, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd briefly, thanked the performers, and suggested that hosting this event in front of the Lincoln Memorial might have been an unprecedented choice. That was not true. In 2009, Mr. Obama held a   concert here, тАЬWe Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. тАЭ It included athletes, actors and musicians from across genres  тАФ   Mary J. Blige singing Bill WithersтАЩs тАЬLean on Me,тАЭ Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen singing тАЬThis Land Is Your Land,тАЭ a song of acceptance and respect for the nation. It was a show of cosmopolitanism and inclusion that portrayed America not as a fixed idea, but as an   sum.
475	After eluding prosecution in the United States for decades and escaping from prison twice in Mexico, the crime lord Joaqu├нn Guzm├бn Loera, better known as El Chapo, appeared on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn and pleaded not guilty to charges that he had overseen a   drug empire. Prosecutors said the operation had moved at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, had earned $14 billion in profits and had been protected by an army of assassins who killed thousands of people. Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs arraignment, in Federal District Court, was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from Mexico on Thursday afternoon, when a police jet flew him from the border to MacArthur Airport in Islip, on Long Island. The brief court proceeding took place under tight security, with police vehicles, heavily armed guards and   dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse. Dressed for his arraignment in a blue     blue pajama pants and blue sneakers, Mr. Guzm├бn, 59, stood with his   lawyers in front of Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in a   courtroom packed with prosecutors, federal agents and reporters. тАЬAre you Mr. Guzm├бn?тАЭ Judge Orenstein asked the defendant. тАЬS├н, se├▒or,тАЭ Mr. Guzm├бn said. The judge then asked Mr. Guzm├бn if he understood the charges he was facing. тАЬS├н, se├▒or,тАЭ he said again. Those charges had been detailed earlier on Friday at a news conference. At the briefing, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, called the extradition of Mr. Guzm├бn, whose nickname means Shorty, a milestone in the pursuit of a trafficker who achieved mythic status in his homeland as a Robin   outlaw and a serial prison escapee. Saying that Mr. Guzm├бn now faced life in prison on a charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise, Mr. Capers sought to play down Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs role as a folk hero and promised that he would not escape his American jailers. тАЬWho is Chapo Guzm├бn?тАЭ Mr. Capers said, flanked by a phalanx of   officials from local, state and federal agencies. тАЬIn short, he is a man who has known no other life than one of crime, violence, death and destruction. тАЭ Even at a courthouse that has seen the prosecution of Mafia dons like John J. Gotti, the onetime Gambino family boss, and corrupt public officials like Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader, the arrival of Mr. Guzm├бn sent a charge through the building, where scores of international reporters were on hand. In an extraordinary confluence of events, Mr. Guzm├бn was taken from Mexico by plane on the eve of the inauguration of Donald J. Trump and was arraigned in Brooklyn only hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in. After the hearing, he was returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a   federal jail that has housed some of New YorkтАЩs   federal defendants, including many facing terrorism charges. As the day began, prosecutors in Brooklyn issued a memo laying out their arguments for keeping Mr. Guzm├бn in custody. They noted his vast wealth and asserted his propensity for violence and his penchant for escaping Mexican prisons  тАФ   most notably, the   Altiplano prison, where he lived in isolation under   surveillance. Nonetheless, he managed to flee after his associates dug a tunnel directly into his shower. Speaking at the news conference, Angel M. Melendez, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in New York, said he had been at the airport Thursday night when Mr. Guzm├бn arrived. Mr. Melendez said he looked into Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs eyes and saw тАЬsurprise, shock and even a bit of fearтАЭ now that he was facing тАЬAmerican justice. тАЭ Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs escapes in Mexico came while he was serving a long sentence on   offenses. Although officials at the gathering refused to discuss details about security measures, Mr. Melendez said, тАЬI can assure you no tunnel will be built to his bathroom. тАЭ Mr. Guzm├бn is facing charges in six federal districts, and Mr. Capers said the decision had been made to prosecute him in Brooklyn, with the assistance of federal prosecutors in Miami, because the two offices working together could bring тАЬthe most forceful punchтАЭ to the case against the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Mr. Capers added that cases in Texas, in California, in Illinois and elsewhere would, for the moment, remain open. The investigation into Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs crimes was conducted by a host of agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In its memo filed Friday, Mr. CapersтАЩs office said it would seek a criminal forfeiture of $14 billion against Mr. Guzm├бn and announced that it planned to call dozens of witnesses to testify about the staggering scope of Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs criminal enterprise: its   shipments of drugs in trucks, planes, yachts, fishing vessels, container ships and submersibles, as well as its numerous killings of witnesses, law enforcement agents, public officials and rival cartel members. The memo also said the government had a vast array of physical evidence, including seized drug stashes and electronic surveillance recordings. The   memorandum of law  тАФ   supplemented with photographs of seized drugs and the planes, boats and submersibles used to smuggle them  тАФ   reads like a history of the modern narcotics business. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Guzm├бn transformed the drug trade with unchecked brutality, remarkable efficiency and brazen corruption. The document tracks his progression from the 1980s, as a smuggler who transported Colombian cocaine to the United States and returned the profits to traffickers there so efficiently that he earned the nickname El R├бpido, through the тАЩ90s, when he began consolidating his control in Mexico. As Colombian traffickers faced increased enforcement of extradition laws, and thus greater threat of prosecution in the United States, they ceded elements of the distribution networks in the United States to Mexican cartels, according to the memo. As Mr. Guzm├бnтАЩs operations grew, prosecutors say, they became increasingly sophisticated. Mr. Guzm├бn also established a complex communications network to allow him to speak covertly with his growing empire without detection by law enforcement, according to the memo. This included тАЬthe use of encrypted networks, multiple insulating layers of   and   methods of communicating with his workers. тАЭ Mr. Guzm├бn also established distribution networks in New York, New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas and California and created тАЬmassive   efforts that delivered billions of dollars in illegal profits generated from the cocaine sales in the United States to the Mexican traffickers and their Colombian partners,тАЭ the memo said. тАЬThese changes,тАЭ it added, тАЬenabled Guzm├бn to exponentially increase his profits to staggering levels. тАЭ
476	The legal record shows that Jerry HartfieldтАЩs first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal, and for the next 32 years, he was not officially guilty of anything, not sentenced to anything. Yet he spent that time in Texas prisons, in what an appellate court now calls тАЬa criminal justice nightmare. тАЭ He was finally tried and convicted again in 2015, but on Thursday, Mr. Hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades. A state Court of Appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years, six years, eight years  тАФ   not 32. The   panel dismissed the indictment against Mr. Hartfield, who is developmentally disabled, in effect erasing the recent conviction. But it is still not clear whether, or when, he will get out of prison. Prosecutors could appeal ThursdayтАЩs ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals, TexasтАЩ highest criminal tribunal. The state Attorney GeneralтАЩs Office, which has argued against Mr. Hartfield, referred questions to the Matagorda County District AttorneyтАЩs Office, which did not reply to requests for comment. тАЬWe are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free,тАЭ Judge Gina M. Benavides wrote for the Court of Appeals. тАЬHowever, based on the United States Constitution, it is the only possible remedy. тАЭ All told, Mr. Hartfield, now 60, has spent more than 40 years behind bars for the murder of a bus station ticket clerk. His case can seem like something out of absurdist fiction: a court ruling ignored or forgotten, an appeal dismissed by a court that agreed with the substance but said it had been filed under the wrong statute, a retrial after most of the evidence had been lost and witnesses had died, and an argument by prosecutors that Mr. Hartfield, himself, was to blame for the delays, and caused them intentionally. тАЬOnce you call this Kafkaesque, you canтАЩt really call anything else Kafkaesque, because thereтАЩs nothing else remotely like this,тАЭ said David R. Dow of the University of Houston Law Center, one of the lawyers who represented Mr. Hartfield on appeal. тАЬThis was the perfect storm of everything that could go wrong with the criminal justice system. тАЭ On Sept. 17, 1976, Eunice Lowe, a    white woman, was killed where she worked, the Continental Trailways station in Bay City, southwest of Houston. The killer bashed in her head with a pickax, stole money from the station and took her car, and there was evidence of sexual assault after death. Mr. Hartfield, a black man, signed a confession that he later disavowed, and, crucially, investigators said he told them where to find Ms. LoweтАЩs car. Experts placed his I. Q. in the 50s or 60s, which his lawyers contend made him easily coerced by detectives, and unable to understand his rights or his confession. A jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. But the Court of Criminal Appeals later overturned that verdict, ruling that a potential juror had been improperly dismissed for having doubts about the death penalty, and ordered a new trial. After years of legal wrangling, the high court ruling took effect in March 1983. Under Texas law at the time, prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction  тАФ   but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court. Because the trial error had to do with capital punishment, if the governor commuted the sentence to life in prison, then it would be as if the appellate court had never ruled, and the guilty verdict would remain in effect. That was apparently never communicated to the prison system. Mr. Dow said that Mr. Hartfield thought he was awaiting a new trial, but did not have the capacity to understand the delay or what to do about it. Whether the District AttorneyтАЩs Office understood what had happened at the time is unclear, but it never took steps to retry him, and the case lay dormant for the next 23 years. Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Hartfield had legal representation all along, because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013. But Mr. HartfieldтАЩs new lawyers say he had no legal counsel from 1983, when the original team thought they were done with the case, until a federal court appointed a lawyer in 2008. Starting in 2006, a fellow inmate helped Mr. Hartfield file motions in various courts. Some were rejected outright, and at least one apparently went to the wrong office. One federal judge ruled in his favor, but another said he had to keep trying in state court. Finally, in 2013, TexasтАЩ Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Mr. HartfieldтАЩs conviction and life sentence were void, but his motions were also void. The motions were filed under a law applying to people who have been convicted, the court said, and there was no valid conviction on record in his case. He refiled under a different provision, and prosecutors finally sought a new trial. Mr. HartfieldтАЩs lawyers said the charges should be dismissed because he was denied a speedy trial. Prosecutors argued that while the government was negligent, the defendant was partly to blame for the delays. For more than two decades, they said, he acquiesced in his imprisonment without trial, as a ploy to avoid the death penalty and to make it harder to mount a case against him. (The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled people cannot be executed.) The District AttorneyтАЩs Office was able to locate just one of the 16 evidence exhibits used at the original trial, several witnesses had died, and at least one had dementia. The murder weapon was lost, along with blood and semen samples that could have yielded DNA. Ms. LoweтАЩs car no longer existed. But the trial court ruled that the case could proceed, and in 2015, 38 years after his first trial, Mr. Hartfield was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. If that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison, he would have been eligible for parole long ago. If he is released based on ThursdayтАЩs ruling, he would probably live with one of his two sisters, Mr. Dow said. тАЬIтАЩm not sure if he knows about this ruling yet,тАЭ Mr. Dow said. тАЬI think itтАЩs unlikely he really understands it very well. тАЭ
477	One night nearly 140 years ago, Samuel Clemens told his young daughters Clara and Susie a bedtime story about a poor boy who eats a magic flower that gives him the ability to talk to animals. Storytelling was a nightly ritual in the Clemens home. But something about this particular tale must have stuck with Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, because he decided to jot down some notes about it. The story might have ended there, lost to history. But decades later, the scholar John Bird was searching the Twain archives at the University of California, Berkeley, when he came across the notes for the story, which Twain titled тАЬOleomargarine. тАЭ Mr. Bird was astonished to find a richly imagined fable, in TwainтАЩs inimitable voice. He and other scholars believe it may be the only written remnant of a childrenтАЩs fairy tale from Twain, though he told his daughters stories constantly. ItтАЩs impossible to know why Twain did not finish the tale, or if he ever intended it for a wider audience. Now, more than a century after Twain dreamed it up, тАЬOleomargarineтАЭ has taken on a strange new afterlife. After consulting a few other scholars, Mr. Bird brought the text to the attention of the Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford, which sold it to Doubleday Books for Young Readers. This fall, Doubleday will release тАЬThe Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine,тАЭ an expanded version of the story that was fleshed out and reimagined by the childrenтАЩs book    team of Philip and Erin Stead. From TwainтАЩs spare   the Steads created a   illustrated story featuring talking animals, giants, dragons, a kidnapped prince and a wicked king. While the original work has a timeless quality, the Steads added a postmodern twist: Twain himself makes an appearance in the book, to argue with the author, Philip Stead, about the direction the story takes. Finishing a partial manuscript by one of the countryтАЩs most revered writers was terrifying at times, the Steads said. тАЬWe said yes before our brains could tell us it was a terrible idea and we would never be able to do it,тАЭ Mr. Stead said in a telephone interview from the coupleтАЩs home studio in Northern Michigan. Erin Stead, who did the illustrations, said they were very aware of the creative risks involved in taking on the work of such a towering literary figure. тАЬWe both just tried to approach the text respectfully and with as much reverence as possible,тАЭ she said. тАЬNo oneтАЩs qualified to write for Mark Twain. тАЭ тАЬOleomargarineтАЭ is the latest abandoned childrenтАЩs tale to resurface decades after a revered writerтАЩs death. In recent years, publishers and estates have dug deep into the archives of beloved childrenтАЩs book authors in search of partial manuscripts and castoff gems, and have released previously unpublished works by Dr. Seuss, Beatrix Potter and Margaret Wise Brown. TwainтАЩs story may hold even greater literary significance for scholars and fans, because it represents a new genre for him. While he wrote fiction, essays, journalism, travelogues, short stories and satire, he never published fiction for very young children, apart from his translation of a German fable. It certainly wasnтАЩt for a lack of ideas. As Twain describes in his journals, his daughters constantly demanded he make up stories on the spot. They often gave him an image from a magazine or another visual prompt to use as inspiration. Sometimes they would insist that his stories mention every knickknack on their living room mantel, beginning with a painting of a cat and ending with a portrait of a young girl. тАЬThey were a difficult and exacting audience  тАФ   those little creatures,тАЭ he wrote of his daughters in his journal. тАЬThe stories had to be absolutely original and fresh. тАЭ Like an artifact from a lost civilization, тАЬOleomargarineтАЭ gives a tantalizing glimpse of the wild, ephemeral tales that Twain spontaneously created for his daughters each night, in the period when he was working on тАЬAdventures of Huckleberry Finn. тАЭ Scholars havenтАЩt found any written remnants of those stories, apart from тАЬOleomargarine,тАЭ which suggests Twain thought it might hold lasting appeal for a wider audience. тАЬHe had at least some inkling that it might be publishable,тАЭ said Robert Hirst, the editor of тАЬWho Is Mark Twain?тАЭ and the curator of TwainтАЩs papers at Berkeley, a vast archive of more than 500 manuscripts. Mr. Bird stumbled on the manuscript in 2011, when he was searching the Twain archives for food references, for a Mark Twain cookbook. The word тАЬoleomargarineтАЭ sounded as if it could be part of a recipe. тАЬWhat I found is what seems to be the only remaining record of these bedtime stories that he told his kids,тАЭ Mr. Bird said. The manuscript was just 16 handwritten pages long, and unfinished. It opens as a poor starving boy named Johnny is given a magic seed, which grows into a flower. He eats it and discovers he can understand animals. Johnny and the animals go on a quest to rescue Prince Oleomargarine, who has been kidnapped by giants and taken to a cave guarded by dragons. At one point, Twain scribbled down a suggestion that his daughter Susie made, when she asked if the kangaroo was the hostess. After finding references to bedtime stories about a boy named Johnny in TwainтАЩs journals, Mr. Bird theorized that Twain had probably told this story to his daughters while the family was in Paris in 1879. Johnny was a recurring character in the nightly tales for the Clemens girls, at least for a while. In a diary that Twain kept about his daughters, he described how they lost interest in Johnny after the character told a lie. тАЬJohnnyтАЩs days of usefulness were over he was up a stump,  I had to leave him there,тАЭ Twain wrote. At first, Mr. Bird was unsure what to do with the fragmentary text. After talking to Mr. Hirst and a few other scholars, he decided that the story offered a significant new perspective on TwainтАЩs domestic life and work, and that it should be published. тАЬItтАЩs a testament to his incredible powers of invention,тАЭ said Mr. Bird, a professor of English at Winthrop University in South Carolina. He wrote his own version, which closely followed TwainтАЩs blueprint and incorporated his language, and took the idea of publishing it to Cindy Lovell, who was then the executive director of the Mark Twain House and Museum. But Mr. BirdтАЩs version, which hewed to the original, was never published. Doubleday, which acquired rights to the story from the Twain House, decided to hire the Steads, who are stars in childrenтАЩs publishing, to finish the story. тАЬWhat we ended up with is this wonderful story inspired by TwainтАЩs unfinished manuscript, which makes any Twain purist uneasy,тАЭ Ms. Lovell said. Mr. Stead secluded himself in a cabin on Beaver Island, in the middle of Lake Michigan, and wrote the first draft of the   story in a feverish nine days. He often found himself arguing with Twain about the changes he wanted to make and found the imagined conversations so compelling that he put them in the book. To capture a rhythm that mirrored TwainтАЩs natural speaking voice, Mr. Stead read the first and second volume of TwainтАЩs autobiography, which Twain had dictated. тАЬI tried to approach the project as a piece of oral history,тАЭ Mr. Stead said. тАЬThis was a story that Twain told his daughters, and now heтАЩs going to tell it to me, and now IтАЩm going to tell it. тАЭ
478	I repeated it to myself as if it were a mantra: Stay on the left. Stay on the left. But the thoughts continued: ThatтАЩs not the turn signal, dummy! The turn signal is on the   side you just turned the wipers on. Remember, the transmission is on your left. Careful, here comes a roundabout! Stay on the left. Stay. On. The. Left. It was an   first 45 minutes, to say the least, from the time I picked up my rental car outside Melbourne Airport to when I settled in and relaxed, at least slightly. Driving in Australia, like driving in London or Hong Kong, means driving on the   side of the road. And if youтАЩve never done it before, it can take a little bit of adjusting. I was determined to make the effort, as this road trip had a particularly appealing payoff. I had just finished a whirlwind tour of MelbourneтАЩs street art scene and had another day in town, and I was resolved to spend it on the Great Ocean Road, considered by many to be one of the worldтАЩs most beautiful scenic drives. Beginning in Torquay, a seaside town about 60 miles southwest of Melbourne, and ending in the town of Allansford, to the west, the road is 150 miles of winding coastline, towering cliffs, lush forests, fascinating wildlife and incredible views of southern Victoria. The construction of the Great Ocean Road dates back to the end of World War I, when returning soldiers set to work on the project. The mayor of Geelong, about 14 miles north of Torquay, had set money aside for the project, which was intended to employ veterans and also commemorate those who had died in the war. Over a decade later, the route was finally completed, both a practical civic improvement and what may be the worldтАЩs largest World War I memorial, indelibly carved into the rocky coastline. After leaving Torquay, the first contact with the ocean comes in the small town of Anglesea. A stiff wind and a small cloudburst caught my little Suzuki as I entered town, setting off my shaky nerves. I took a deep breath and reminded myself that IтАЩd at least gotten the insurance on the rental car. The strong sun had   but the breeze took the edge off the heat, and the ocean air was sharp in my nose. I grabbed a snack at the Oaks Bakery Cafe  тАФ   a chunky prawn and scallop hand pie with a hot, flaky crust for 6. 50 Australian dollars (about $4. 85). In the parking lot, some friendly wild cockatoos were hanging around, scavenging for dropped food. I parked on a dirt road near Seventh Avenue, a little ways from the center of Anglesea, and, from a cliff slightly above sea level, was treated to a beautiful view of the beach and ocean: cobalt blue in patches, sea foam green in others. I hiked down the hill through the bush, a small, forested patch called the Lorne Queenscliff Coastal Reserve, past native trees and shrubs of common heath, soft   and manna gum trees. Oh, and flies. Everywhere. The flies in Australia are relentless. TheyтАЩre far more brazen than the meek little house flies in the United States Australian flies will land on your face again and again, requiring you to constantly wave them off. This continual shooing motion is sometimes called the Aussie salute. At one point I thought I was rid of my companions, but when I turned around and peeked at the back of my shirt, I saw about a dozen of them hitching a ride. You get used to it. But I recommend investing in some bug spray. The flies eased up once I emerged from the shade of the trees and reached the beach. A long swath of sand greeted me, along with limpid ocean water and the sound of lapping waves. I was the only person on the beach. I was already satisfied with this   and IтАЩd barely gotten started. I was satisfied, too, with how I had started the trip  тАФ   an important decision. There is a local airport outside Avalon, closer than Melbourne to the start of the Great Ocean Road, that I could have flown into (on Jetstar, an Australian   airline) and rented a car. I also considered flying into Warrnambool Airport (Sharp Airlines services this airport regularly) near Allansford, and driving east instead of west, which would have meant renting a car one way and driving it to Melbourne. But the   rental would have cost around 200 dollars more. I knew I had to come back to Melbourne Airport, since I was flying out of there early the next morning, so I rented a car near the airport through Sixt Rent a Car for 44 Australian dollars. The insurance policy (purely elective, but reassuring for those who have never driven on the   side of the road  тАФ   not purposely, anyway) brought the total to around 70 dollars. I ended up driving most of the Great Ocean Road in the Suzuki, then doubling back near Lavers Hill when it got dark and heading back to Melbourne. Warned by periodic road signs reminding me to drive on the left in Australia, I continued from Anglesea down to Aireys Inlet, stopping to see the Split Point Lighthouse, a beautiful, massive white pillar against the blue sea. The lighthouse was constructed in 1891, after a slew of shipwrecks along the rocky coast. I passed on the tour, but there are guided (14 dollars) and   (10 dollars) ones available. I was feeling more comfortable behind the wheel by the time I arrived in Lorne, one of the towns to which the Great Ocean Road was intended to ease access. (I had set off the windshield wipers just once or twice in the previous hour or so, and had managed to parallel park with moderate success.) The drive was even becoming, dare I say, enjoyable: The constant twists and hairpin turns in the road made for a lot of fun. I approached a bend in the road in Lorne, near three majestic conifers, and stopped at the imposing Grand Pacific Hotel, an 1870s landmark that was originally accessible only by sea. I had a cup of tea (4 dollars) and a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (3 dollars). I recommend you do what I did: Take your tea up to the second floor and sit on the balcony. The panoramic views  тАФ   even in an area with an embarrassment of visual riches  тАФ   are fantastic. A friend had tipped me off about the location of some wild koalas, so I made a beeline out of Lorne toward Kennett River, where there is a small park. An access road near the appropriately named Kafe Koala took me into a eucalyptus forest  тАФ   just as a downpour began. I had to move fast. I trudged up the muddy road, looking in the branches of the trees: nothing. After a bit more walking, I heard something: a frenetic grunt, a noise I imagined a warthog would make. I looked up, rain pelting my face, and saw two fuzzy gray shapes chasing each other up the trunk of a tree with   bark. Koalas! And they seemed mad. They were spitting and hissing at each other, and making incredibly, well,   noises. Once I noticed these koalas, I saw others everywhere. Perched in tree branches, snoozing, munching on eucalyptus leaves or chasing one another in playful and    ways. (Koalas, incidentally, are suffering a horrible chlamydia outbreak. I still found them adorable.) But it was time to get out of the rain. I zigzagged through a large group of cockatoos and brightly colored crimson rosella parrots and hopped back into the car. I was on high alert again on the road (and of course, when I tried to turn the windshield wipers on, I promptly turned on the turn signal). I had to pull over to let by a big truck that was riding my tail. On the way toward Great Otway National Park, I recommend checking out a few of the many places to turn off and enjoy the scenery. Cape Patton Lookout Point is particularly   and bucolic, with sweeping views of both the ocean and the surrounding bush. And itтАЩs not just views  тАФ   access points to the beach are plentiful. I spent some quality time on the beach in Apollo Bay, approaching it from Gambier Street. Much of what the Great Ocean Road has to offer is simply handed to travelers: Even just driving it, I couldnтАЩt help but take in its beauty. A few things, though, are a bit more difficult to get to. Lighthouses abound in Victoria, and the Cape Otway Lightstation, the oldest working lighthouse in Australia  тАФ   and тАЬthe most important,тАЭ according to the website  тАФ   is worth going the extra mile. The lighthouse is far south on the tip of Victoria  тАФ   a detour from the main road through the national park. The environs changed quickly: I was chugging along amid beautiful ocean scenery when suddenly I was in a lush,   forest. Just as quickly, I was in dry, barren bush that looked almost apocalyptic. About seven miles after I turned off the main road, I made it to the Cape. And after a moderate hike, I was staring at the tiny, perfect lighthouse in the distance. The area is particularly remote and isolated  тАФ   I encountered only two other people on my detour. ThereтАЩs a sense of immense calm about the place, and while itтАЩs not the southernmost point in Australia, it feels just as distant. From that point on, for the rest of my drive along the Great Ocean Road, and back to Melbourne, I felt pretty much at ease. No more   no more mistakes with the windshield wipers. Driving on the left wasnтАЩt second nature, but I had definitely gotten the hang of it.
479	The judge was intrigued. Before her in a hearing room on Staten Island sat Cristy Matteo, the owner of a pet pig named Wilbur. She was accused of illegally harboring a wild animal. The judge said that she knew of only one other pig that had been through the system, Ms. Matteo recalled. The judge named the pig. Ms. Matteo immediately named the pigтАЩs owner. тАЬThe judge was smiling at me,тАЭ Ms. Matteo said. The judge asked if there was an underground pig network in New York. тАЬI said, тАШMore than you can imagine. тАЩтАЭ An untold number of pet pigs are scattered throughout the city, despite a ban. They can be found in all five boroughs, the veterinarians who treat them say. тАЬThere are so, so many of us,тАЭ said a neighbor of Ms. MatteoтАЩs who has two pigs and gave her name only as Leslie W. Ms. Matteo said she knew of dozens. Wilbur, however, a placid   with a fondness for orange peppers and daylong naps, is about to leave their ranks. Though the judge dismissed the violation last May, accepting Ms. MatteoтАЩs explanation that Wilbur was an emotional support animal for her and her father, the cityтАЩs health department got the dismissal overturned. Ms. Matteo, 46,  must get rid of Wilbur by the end of the month. She has lined up a sanctuary in North Carolina for him, but she is not ready to give him up. тАЬIтАЩm just praying that something gives between now and Jan. 31,тАЭ she said on Monday as Wilbur grunted quietly beside her in her living room on Staten IslandтАЩs South Shore. The cityтАЩs porcine ranks include a storeтАЩs wandering mascot and a spotted pig who frequents Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. Some pigs live as discreetly as it is possible to do in a dense city. Others lead lives like Queelin, a Manhattan resident who is walked in a park near her apartment each day. She has a Facebook account, was the model for a childrenтАЩs book called тАЬThe New Yorker PorkerтАЭ and draws attention wherever she goes. тАЬYou basically cannot walk her if youтАЩre in a bad mood or if youтАЩre in a hurry,тАЭ said her owner, who gave her name only as Ann, citing the hostile legal climate. Ms. Matteo, who works for a tugboat company, got a piglet on a whim. тАЬI just woke up one morning and said, тАШIтАЩm buying one,тАЩтАЭ she said. That was five years  тАФ   and 165 pounds  тАФ   ago. Wilbur became close friends with Ms. MatteoтАЩs exuberant golden retriever mix, Milo. Wilbur was soon using a doggy door to go out into the yard to relieve himself, root around for leaves and occasionally roll in the mud. The neighborsтАЩ grandchildren fed him carrots, Ms. Matteo said. Then last winter, someone complained to 311. (Ms. Matteo thinks she knows who but declined to offer details.) On March 1  тАФ   National Pig Day  тАФ   a health inspector knocked on the door, and Ms. MatteoтАЩs ailing father, a cancer patient, let him in. A summons followed. The inspector had observed тАЬone large   pig lying on its bed in the living room area of the property. тАЭ Ms. Matteo was charged with violating a provision of the city health code prohibiting тАЬall   ungulates,тАЭ including but not limited to тАЬdeer, antelope, sheep, pigs, including pot bellied pigs, goats, cattle, giraffe and hippopotamus. тАЭ In New YorkтАЩs founding days, pigs roamed the streets, devouring trash and functioning as a   municipal sanitation force. During the early 19th century, the city began passing laws against harboring pigs. Although they eventually disappeared from the streets, they still made cameos. When the Hotel Thorndyke in Midtown caught fire in 1920, The New York Times reported, тАЬMiss Helen Lee Worthing, who is in the Greenwich Village Follies, returned to her room to rescue a pet baby pig used in that production and which she had left sleeping in its basket. тАЭ Pigs made a comeback with the potbellied pig craze in the 1980s and тАЩ90s and have maintained a steady presence ever since. In 2013, as a woman in Queens fought  to keep her pig, Petey, State Senator Tony Avella introduced a bill in the Legislature to legalize pet pigs under 200 pounds statewide. тАЬOver the years, pygmy pigs have gained popularity and recognition as great pets due to the combination of their unique traits such as cleanliness, diminutive size, friendly disposition and intelligence,тАЭ the   bill says. It has yet to pass. The health department opposes it, for several reasons. тАЬPigs raised as house pets can become aggressive to humans,тАЭ the agency said in a recent statement. Also, it noted, there is no federally approved rabies vaccine for pigs. In 2014, the most recent year for which federal statistics are available, there were no cases of rabies in pigs reported in the United States, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were, however, 272 rabid cats, 59 rabid dogs and one rabid llama. Pig owners scoff at the notion that their pets pose a threat. тАЬItтАЩs ridiculous how many people are abusing their animals, how many dogs are mauling people, and theyтАЩre worrying about a pig thatтАЩs not even bothering anybody,тАЭ said Nadine Darsanlal, a disabled veteran who lives in Queens and owns a working therapy pig, also named Wilbur. (The classic childrenтАЩs book тАЬCharlotteтАЩs WebтАЭ ensures that many pet pigs continue to be named Wilbur.) She keeps him at a friendтАЩs house outside the city, where pigs are legal. At QueelinтАЩs apartment in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, the lawbreaker snoozed on her bed in the corner. Her ownerтАЩs older daughter, a college student who asked to be identified only as Margret, eventually persuaded Queelin to get up. In return for treats, Queelin (an Anglicization of her real name, Caoilfhionn, which means тАЬfair and slenderтАЭ in Irish) sat like a dog and kissed Margret on the lips. Margret lay down on the couch, and Queelin climbed up and plopped on top of her. тАЬShe knows how to trap you because she puts her big head on you,тАЭ Margret said as she stroked QueelinтАЩs    bristles. тАЬThen sheтАЩs so happy. тАЭ Queelin gave a soft snort of agreement.
480	DAKAR, Senegal  тАФ   The political standoff in Gambia intensified on Thursday as foreign troops crossed the border with orders to dislodge a repressive leader who has refused to step down after losing a presidential election last month. GambiaтАЩs erratic leader, Yahya Jammeh, seized power in a coup 22 years ago and once said he could rule for a billion years. But on Thursday the Senegalese military headed toward the capital of Gambia, Banjul, where Mr. Jammeh has been holed up in the state house, insisting that his rule is still valid. Mr. Jammeh has warned that he will fight back against any foreign military intervention. At least 26, 000 Gambians, worried about violence, have fled the country, the United Nations says, and several senior officials in Mr. JammehтАЩs government have resigned in protest or have left the nation as well. As the invasion began, the winner of the election, Adama Barrow, was being sworn into office in a brief ceremony about 150 miles outside of Gambia. The inauguration took place in a nondescript room at the Gambian Embassy in Dakar, Senegal, because Mr. Barrow has so little control over his country that he did not go home for the funeral of his son, who had been killed by a dog over the weekend. Mr. BarrowтАЩs team ultimately decided that the embassy in Dakar was the closest they could safely get to Gambian soil to start the new administration. Plans for an elaborate ceremony in a soccer stadium in GambiaтАЩs capital had to be scrapped amid the standoff. тАЬItтАЩs not necessarily the kind of ceremony to be jubilant about, but the situation is dangerous,тАЭ said Halifa Sallah, a spokesman for Mr. Barrow. But late on Thursday it appeared the situation could still be resolved without a fight. State television broadcast news that the presidents of Liberia, Mauritania and Guinea would arrive Friday to negotiate a resolution. A Senegalese military official said troops would stand by for talks. During the inauguration in Senegal, Mr. Barrow arrived to enthusiastic whoops from hundreds of supporters and emerged from a motorcade beaming. He was sworn in just before 5 p. m. his hand on a Quran, pledging to serve his country тАЬwithout fear or favor. тАЭ Several people who had gathered outside to watch on a large television screen shouted, тАЬNo more dictatorship!тАЭ In a brief speech, the   Mr. Barrow called on the Gambian security forces to pledge their loyalty to him, asking that the military stay in their barracks. тАЬWe are one Gambia, one people,тАЭ he said. Gambia has suffered high unemployment and political repression for years under Mr. Jammeh, with many citizens abandoning the country to risk perilous and often deadly journeys to Europe by sea. Minutes after Mr. Barrow was sworn in, celebrations erupted across Gambia, with thousands gathering in some areas. Lamin Demba, a welder, said he felt like a free man. Joining others in celebration in front of his welding shop with piles of metal, he took out his phone and called a relative in Italy. тАЬCome back home boy, we are free now,тАЭ he shouted into the phone. тАЬNow Gambia is free. тАЭ But while Mr. Barrow has popular support in Gambia, it has not been enough to dislodge the erratic Mr. Jammeh. After initially accepting defeat in the election, he suddenly cited voting irregularities and called for a new vote. тАЬHe is still the president,тАЭ said Seedy Njie, GambiaтАЩs minister of information, communication and technology. тАЬSo, yes, he is here. тАЭ This week, GambiaтАЩs Parliament voted to extend Mr. JammehтАЩs term for three months, though international officials denounced the move and many analysts consider it unconstitutional. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday supporting the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to Mr. Barrow. The resolution, presented by Senegal, which has a rotating seat on the council, offers тАЬits full support to the Ecowas in its commitment to ensure by political means first the respect of the will of the peopleтАЭ of Gambia in the election that ousted Mr. Jammeh from office. The speed with which the council has taken action shows how little support Mr. Jammeh has among world powers. He has overseen a legacy of human rights abuses, including imprisoning opponents and declaring that gay people should be beheaded. He has claimed to have the ability to cure AIDS with little more than an herbal concoction. Mr. Barrow, by contrast, is an unassuming real estate agent who fell into the candidateтАЩs position after Mr. Jammeh jailed other opposition party members. He left the country last week to meet with West African leaders to discuss how to resolve the matter of taking over the presidency. Fearing for his safety at home, he wound up in Senegal, which surrounds Gambia on three sides and has a huge stake in GambiaтАЩs stability. Mr. JammehтАЩs circle of friends has been shrinking considerably in recent days. The African Union said it would fail to recognize him as president as of Thursday. The presidents of Liberia and Mauritania met with him to urge him to step down, to no avail. His chief spokesman and longtime mouthpiece fled the country. Many of his ministers resigned. Mr. Jammeh has tried numerous channels to cling to power. He appealed to the Supreme Court, but because he had fired most of the judges and failed to replace them, a full panel could not be assembled in time to hear his case. This week, Mr. Jammeh declared a state of emergency in the country. He shut three independent radio stations and his officers arrested people selling #GambiaHasDecided  . For now, it appears members of the security forces are staying loyal to him. But with Mr. Jammeh lacking a broad support base, his ability to provide for supporters who have lived off his good graces for years will be challenged. тАЬHe has nothing left, really,тАЭ said Mr. Sallah, Mr. BarrowтАЩs spokesman. тАЬIn the end I donтАЩt see how he can stay. тАЭ Mariam Sakho, a Gambian waitress in Banjul, said she was confident that Mr. Jammeh would step down, especially now that many of his ministers were deserting him. тАЬYesterday, my boss say I should not come to work because it is not safe,тАЭ she said. тАЬBut for me, I believe nothing will happen, so I told him I will come. Everybody is tired with Yahya Jammeh I believe he will go. тАЭ People stayed glued to radios for news, while many Barrow supporters celebrated openly. тАЬNobody can stop me,тАЭ said Fatou Njie, a Barrow supporter. тАЬIt is my right. тАЭ
481	RIO DE JANEIRO  тАФ   The Supreme Court justice overseeing parts of the investigation into corruption at BrazilтАЩs national oil company died on Thursday in the crash of a small plane, stunning the country as investigators are intensifying their efforts to prosecute an array of political figures on graft charges. The justice, Teori Zavascki, 68, was killed along with at least two other people traveling on a Beechcraft King Air C90 when it crashed into the Atlantic near Paraty, a town of   buildings on the coast between S├гo Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, according to Brazilian news reports. The cause of the crash was unknown as of Thursday night. The federal police have begun an investigation that will be closely watched across Brazil, given Justice ZavasckiтАЩs influence in BrazilтАЩs legal system. Justice Zavascki, who had kept a low public profile since being named to the   court in 2012, was responsible for some of the boldest moves in BrazilтАЩs judiciary in recent years, earning him a reputation as a judge prepared to curb abuses by influential lawmakers and business leaders. In 2015, Justice Zavascki ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Delc├нdio do Amaral, a sitting senator from the leftist WorkersтАЩ Party, which was in power at the time. And in 2016, he ousted the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who had orchestrated the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Large portions of BrazilтАЩs political establishment are on edge over revelations of bribery by Odebrecht, the construction giant that was one of the largest contractors for Petrobras, the   oil company. Justice Zavascki was overseeing the ratification of OdebrechtтАЩs plea deal, in which dozens of Brazilian politicians are accused of receiving funds from the company, and some prominent figures suggested that the plane crash could have been a result of foul play. тАЬThis тАШaccidentтАЩ needs to be thoroughly investigated,тАЭ M├бrcio Adriano Anselmo, a federal investigator on the Petrobras case, said in a Facebook post. Mr. Anselmo called Justice ZavasckiтАЩs death тАЬthe prelude to the end of an eraтАЭ before editing and removing parts of the post. Justice ZavasckiтАЩs death raises important concerns about the direction of the Petrobras investigation and the independence of the judiciary. President Michel Temer will be able to nominate a replacement, influencing the Supreme Court while his own   Brazilian Democratic Movement Party is facing intense criticism over graft cases and efforts to stifle the Petrobras inquiry. Within the court, justices were maneuvering quickly on Thursday to nominate a successor to oversee the Petrobras case, expressing concern about delays that could allow legislators to avoid going to jail. Under Brazilian law, the Supreme Court handles cases involving lawmakers and other senior politicians who enjoy special legal standing. Justice Marco Aur├йlio Mello said it would be a mistake to await Mr. TemerтАЩs nomination of a new court member, which would be followed by Senate hearings that could take almost a year. тАЬWe cannot wait,тАЭ Mr. Mello said, citing the demands of the Petrobras investigation, called Operation Carwash in reference to a service station in the capital, Bras├нlia, that laundered money. The plane carrying Justice Zavascki was owned by Emiliano, a Brazilian luxury hotel operator. The owner of Emiliano, Carlos Alberto Filgueiras, 69, and the pilot of the plane, Osmar Rodrigues, 56, also died in the crash. The hotel company said in a statement that Justice Zavascki and Mr. Filgueiras were тАЬclose friends. тАЭ Brazilian news outlets also reported that a woman, whose identity was not disclosed, had died. Justice Zavascki, a specialist in tax legislation before becoming a judge, was named to the court by Ms. Rousseff, who was replaced last year by Mr. Temer, her vice president. Sergio Moro, the judge overseeing much of the Petrobras inquiry, called Justice Zavascki тАЬan example for all judges, prosecutors and lawyers in this country. тАЭ тАЬWithout him, there would not have been the Carwash investigation,тАЭ Judge Moro said. Legal scholars agreed that BrazilтАЩs Supreme Court, along with Justice ZavasckiтАЩs replacement, would come under scrutiny. тАЬThis thing isnтАЩt for amateurs,тАЭ said Antonio Valverde, a professor of ethics and philosophy at Catholic University in S├гo Paulo, citing reports that some of BrazilтАЩs most powerful men received bribes in the Carwash inquiry. тАЬThe names in those reports are in the federal government. тАЭ
482	Fifty years ago right about now, two unassuming young brothers were standing in front of a CBS studio audience taping the first episode of their new variety show. They were also about to unleash the modern concept of television buzz, in a storm the likes of which the medium had not seen. They were the Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, and the    story of their show, тАЬThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,тАЭ is worth recalling 50 years on as a case study that may prove newly relevant as a president with a habit of attacking TV shows via Twitter settles into office. That first episode, taped in late January and broadcast Feb. 5, 1967, wasnтАЩt incendiary, but some that came later were spectacularly so. The brothers inflamed CBS censors and segments of their audience by injecting sexual innuendo, drug references, religion and especially politics into the typically bland   format, drawing, in Season 3, a   firing. The story of the show can seem  . The brothers were delivering two things that every network today covets: a lot of attention and a young audience. Why kill that    goose? The answer lies in the newness of it all. In 1967, no one knew quite how to exploit controversy and   conversation the way   publicists do. The series was CBSтАЩs latest effort to compete against тАЬBonanza,тАЭ the NBC staple that had owned Sunday nights for years. The brothers had a     stage act in which Tom, on guitar, played a dimwit, and Dick, on bass, was the straight man. The dynamic translated exceedingly well to TV. Dick Smothers, now 77, who lives in Florida and advocates fitness and balance programs for older people, was a bit surprised by the showтАЩs popularity at first. тАЬI didnтАЩt think we sang that well,тАЭ he said. тАЬNow I can see the genuineness, the whimsy that we had. тАЭ The series was remarkable for its   approach, mixing established guest stars with newcomers and rock acts. A September 1967 installment had Bette Davis, Mickey Rooney and the Who, whose   finale that night is said to have damaged Pete TownshendтАЩs hearing. The multigenerational lineups led to ratings success some weeks, the show even outdrew тАЬBonanza. тАЭ But the humor content increasingly reflected contentious times, and by Season 2, clashes with CBSтАЩs censors were frequent. тАЬThey had something to offend everybody,тАЭ William H. Tankersley, then the executive in charge of programming standards and practices at CBS, said in a 2001 interview with the Archive of American Television, still sounding peeved. (Mr. Tankersley died last year at 98.) тАЬThey brought more complaints than any show in history on CBS. They injected politics up to the sky. They refused to do anything that we asked. тАЭ The CBS response, though, was oddly inconsistent, evidence of how uncharted this territory was. Pete SeegerтАЩs performance of the antiwar тАЬWaist Deep in the Big MuddyтАЭ was cut out of his performance in an early Season 2 episode, but five months later he was allowed to sing the song. What today seems barely saucy would be cut. One early battle involved efforts to say тАЬfriggetтАЭ instead of тАЬribbetтАЭ in a frog sketch, David Bianculli recounts in тАЬDangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. тАЭ A sort of guerrilla war broke out in which banned material would turn up in newspapers, including this one as early as April 1967, The New York Times reprinted a sketch by Elaine May that the network had killed. Yet some of the material that made it onto the air was pointed enough to raise eyebrows even today. A series of sketches in a December 1967 episode, for instance, mocked the American obsession with guns mercilessly. In one bit, a   contestant was to take shots at three hidden figures in hopes of killing either a stranger, a celebrity or his own wife. If the network was surprised by the showтАЩs success and all the controversy, people on the creative side of things were, too. тАЬI was na├пve enough to think that nobody was watching except my friends,тАЭ said David Steinberg, who was then a   comedian who had made a few тАЬTonight ShowтАЭ appearances. тАЬWe didnтАЩt know that we were bothering the government. тАЭ In Season 3, Mr. Steinberg did one of his satirical тАЬsermonettes,тАЭ in which he tweaked religion, a subject that television of the day didnтАЩt like to touch. Some time after that appearance, he said, he dropped by the showтАЩs headquarters and Tom Smothers dragged him to a room that contained a bunch of bulging duffel bags. тАЬI said, тАШWhat is this? тАЩтАЭ Mr. Steinberg recalled. тАЬAnd he said, тАШItтАЩs your hate mail. тАЩтАЭ In March 1969, Tom Smothers asked Mr. Steinberg to do another sermonette, although the network had banned the bit. That move is often credited with being the last straw, though it was just one of many, many straws. In any case, the network fired the Smotherses and canceled the show, though it was still pulling in decent ratings. Since those times, networks have learned that a certain amount of boundary pushing is healthy politicians have become more adept at manipulating TV and the people on the creative side have begun to understand that being on TV, especially in network prime time, requires compromises. That learning process continues today just ask Keith Olbermann or Bill Maher,   hosts whose mouths have landed them in hot water. Yet     content, the thing that got the Smothers Brothers in trouble, is all over prime time, even on comedies like тАЬ . тАЭ And now comes Donald J. Trump, who seems to have thin skin. The Smotherses incurred the wrath of two presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. Tom Smothers, who turns 80 in February, said in an interview in 2000 that he had always believed Nixon was directly responsible for his showтАЩs demise. тАЬThere was a bigger game going on that was beyond our scope of understanding,тАЭ he said. Who knows what games lie ahead as a Twitter president takes office?
483	Geneticists tell us that somewhere between 1 and 5 percent of the genome of modern Europeans and Asians consists of DNA inherited from Neanderthals, our prehistoric cousins. At Vanderbilt University, John Anthony Capra, an evolutionary genomics professor, has been combining   computation and a medical records databank to learn what a Neanderthal heritage  тАФ   even a fractional one  тАФ   might mean for people today. We spoke for two hours when Dr. Capra, 35, recently passed through New York City. An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows. Q. LetтАЩs begin with an indiscreet question. How did contemporary people come to have Neanderthal DNA on their genomes? A. We hypothesize that roughly 50, 000 years ago, when the ancestors of modern humans migrated out of Africa and into Eurasia, they encountered Neanderthals. Matings must have occurred then. And later. One reason we deduce this is because the descendants of those who remained in Africa  тАФ   present day Africans  тАФ   donтАЩt have Neanderthal DNA. What does that mean for people who have it?  At my lab, weтАЩve been doing genetic testing on the blood samples of 28, 000 patients at Vanderbilt and eight other medical centers across the country. Computers help us pinpoint where on the human genome this Neanderthal DNA is, and we run that against information from the patientsтАЩ anonymized medical records. WeтАЩre looking for associations. What weтАЩve been finding is that Neanderthal DNA has a subtle influence on risk for disease. It affects our immune system and how we respond to different immune challenges. It affects our skin. YouтАЩre slightly more prone to a condition where you can get scaly lesions after extreme sun exposure. ThereтАЩs an increased risk for blood clots and tobacco addiction. To our surprise, it appears that some Neanderthal DNA can increase the risk for depression however, there are other Neanderthal bits that decrease the risk. Roughly 1 to 2 percent of oneтАЩs risk for depression is determined by Neanderthal DNA. It all depends on where on the genome itтАЩs located. Was there ever an upside to having Neanderthal DNA?  It probably helped our ancestors survive in prehistoric Europe. When humans migrated into Eurasia, they encountered unfamiliar hazards and pathogens. By mating with Neanderthals, they gave their offspring needed defenses and immunities. That trait for blood clotting helped wounds close up quickly. In the modern world, however, this trait means greater risk for stroke and pregnancy complications. What helped us then doesnтАЩt necessarily now. Did you say earlier that Neanderthal DNA increases susceptibility to nicotine addiction? Yes. Neanderthal DNA can mean youтАЩre more likely to get hooked on nicotine, even though there were no tobacco plants in archaic Europe. We think this might be because thereтАЩs a bit of Neanderthal DNA right next to a human gene thatтАЩs a neurotransmitter implicated in a generalized risk for addiction. In this case and probably others, we think the Neanderthal bits on the genome may serve as switches that turn human genes on or off. Aside from the Neanderthals, do we know if our ancestors mated with other hominids? We think they did. Sometimes when weтАЩre examining genomes, we can see the genetic afterimages of hominids who havenтАЩt even been identified yet. A few years ago, the Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo received an unusual fossilized bone fragment from Siberia. He extracted the DNA, sequenced it and realized it was neither human nor Neanderthal. What Paabo found was a previously unknown hominid he named Denisovan, after the cave where it had been discovered. It turned out that Denisovan DNA can be found on the genomes of modern Southeast Asians and New Guineans. Have you long been interested in genetics? Growing up, I was very interested in history, but I also loved computers. I ended up majoring in computer science at college and going to graduate school in it however, during my first year in graduate school, I realized I wasnтАЩt very motivated by the problems that computer scientists worked on. Fortunately, around that time  тАФ   the early 2000s  тАФ   it was becoming clear that people with computational skills could have a big impact in biology and genetics. The human genome had just been mapped. What an accomplishment! We now had the code to what makes you, you, and me, me. I wanted to be part of that kind of work. So I switched over to biology. And it was there that I heard about a new field where you used computation and genetics research to look back in time  тАФ   evolutionary genomics. There may be no written records from prehistory, but genomes are a living record. If we can find ways to read them, we can discover things we couldnтАЩt know any other way. Not long ago, the two top editors of The New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial questioning тАЬdata sharing,тАЭ a common practice where scientists recycle raw data other researchers have collected for their own studies. They labeled some of the recycling researchers, тАЬdata parasites. тАЭ How did you feel when you read that?  I was upset. The data sets we used were not originally collected to specifically study Neanderthal DNA in modern humans. Thousands of patients at Vanderbilt consented to have their blood and their medical records deposited in a тАЬbiobankтАЭ to find genetic diseases. Three years ago, when I set up my lab at Vanderbilt, I saw the potential of the biobank for studying both genetic diseases and human evolution. I wrote special computer programs so that we could mine existing data for these purposes. ThatтАЩs not being a тАЬparasite. тАЭ ThatтАЩs moving knowledge forward. I suspect that most of the patients who contributed their information are pleased to see it used in a wider way. What has been the response to your Neanderthal research since you published it last year in the journal Science?  Some of itтАЩs very touching. People are interested in learning about where they came from. Some of it is a little silly. тАЬI have a lot of hair on my legs  тАФ   is that from Neanderthals?тАЭ But I received racist inquiries, too. I got calls from all over the world from people who thought that since Africans didnтАЩt interbreed with Neanderthals, this somehow justified their ideas of white superiority. It was illogical. Actually, Neanderthal DNA is mostly bad for us  тАФ   though that didnтАЩt bother them. As you do your studies, do you ever wonder about what the lives of the Neanderthals were like? ItтАЩs hard not to. Genetics has taught us a tremendous amount about that, and thereтАЩs a lot of evidence that they were much more human than apelike. TheyтАЩve gotten a bad rap. We tend to think of them as dumb and brutish. ThereтАЩs no reason to believe that. Maybe those of us of European heritage should be thinking, тАЬLetтАЩs improve their standing in the popular imagination. TheyтАЩre our ancestors, too. тАЩтАЭ
484	тАв Hundreds of thousands of women gathered in Washington on Saturday in a kind of counterinauguration after President Trump took office on Friday. A range of speakers and performers cutting across generational lines rallied near the Capitol before marchers made their way toward the White House. тАв They were joined by crowds in cities across the country: In Chicago, the size of a rally so quickly outgrew early estimates that the march that was to follow was canceled for safety. In Manhattan, Fifth Avenue became a river of pink hats, while in downtown Los Angeles, even before the gathering crowd stretched itself out to march, it was more than a quarter mile deep on several streets. тАв Begun as a Facebook post just after the election, the march is the start of what organizers hope could be a sustained campaign of protest in a polarized America, unifying demonstrators around issues like reproductive rights, immigration and civil rights. The movement has also encountered divisions. тАв The Times had journalists covering the marches in Washington New York Boston Atlanta Denver Los Angeles Phoenix St. Paul and Key West, Fla. Check out what they posted on Twitter and what readers asked of them live. See photos from marches around the world, too. (All times listed below are local.) (Or watch video of the whole event.) тАв The singer and actress Janelle Monae highlighted the issue of police violence, leading the crowd in a chant of тАЬSandra Bland! Say her name!тАЭ a reference to the   case where a black woman died in police custody in Texas after being arrested in 2015. She then brought the microphone to each of the women in тАЬMothers of the MovementтАЭ who had joined her onstage. One by one, they joined in the chant, each inserting the name of her child who had died at the hands of the police. тАв The actress Ashley Judd delivered an uninhibited speech that ended with her referencing how Mr. Trump bragged, in a 2005 recording, that he could use his celebrity status to force himself on women, even groping their private parts. They тАЬainтАЩt for grabbing,тАЭ she said. тАЬThey are for birthing new generations of filthy, vulgar, nasty, proud, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, you name it, for new generations of nasty women. тАЭ тАв Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon of the 1960s and 1970s, told the women in the group to get to know one another more personally. тАЬMake sure you introduce yourselves to each other and decide what weтАЩre going to do tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow,тАЭ she said. тАЬWeтАЩre never turning back!тАЭ тАв тАЬItтАЩs been a   time to be both a woman and an immigrant in this country,тАЭ said the actress and activist America Ferrera. тАЬBut the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is not America. We are America! And we are here to stay. тАЭ тАв After getting to the crowd to repeat a number to call Congress, the filmmaker Michael Moore urged people to run for office: тАЬThis is not the time for shy people! Shy people, you have two hours to get over it. тАЭ тАв The actress Scarlett Johansson told a story about how she had visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in New York City after starting her acting career, and how a doctor there had treated her with compassion, тАЬno judgment, no questions asked. тАЭ тАЬI feel that in the face of this current political climate, it is vital that we all make it our mission to get really, really personal,тАЭ she said. тАЬPresident Trump, I did not vote for you,тАЭ she continued. тАЬI want to be able to support you. But first I ask that you support me. Support my sister. Support my mother. Support my best friend and all of our girlfriends. тАЭ Otherwise, Ms. Johansson said, her own daughter, тАЬmay potentially not have the right to make choices for her body and her future that your daughter Ivanka has been privileged to have. тАЭ _____ Many participants believed that Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign, with remarks about Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina and Hillary Clinton. After the 2005 recording surfaced, several women came forward to accuse Mr. Trump of inappropriate sexual conduct. He dismissed the recording as тАЬlocker room banterтАЭ and assailed his accusers. In a sly allusion to the crude remarks Mr. Trump made in the recording, many marchers, men and women alike, wore pink тАЬpussyhats,тАЭ complete with cat ears. The hats are described on pussyhatproject. com as a way to тАЬmake a unique collective visual statement which will help activists be better heard. тАЭ _____ Just after 10 a. m. Mr. Trump and his family headed in the opposite direction of the march in Washington for the National Prayer Service, an inaugural tradition, at the National Cathedral. When he spoke at C. I. A. headquarters in Langley, Va. in the midafternoon, he told his audience that they were his тАЬNo. 1 stopтАЭ on his first full day in office, because they were тАЬreally special amazing people. тАЭ He also ruminated about how big the attendance had been at his inaugural speech, but he did not mention the large crowds of the womenтАЩs march, where demonstrators were challenging his administration on a number of policies, or even that the march was taking place as he was speaking. _____ Mrs. Clinton was not expected to attend the march in Washington, The Times reported on Friday, but her Twitter account sent a midmorning note anyway. _____ In a speech in Boston, Ms. Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said fundamental freedoms, like abortion rights and gay marriage, could be at stake under Mr. TrumpтАЩs Supreme Court. тАЬWe can whimper, we can whine or we can fight back,тАЭ she said, as demonstrators in pink hats waved American flags. тАЬMe, IтАЩm here to fight back. тАЭ тАЬWe believe in science,тАЭ Ms. Warren said, adding, тАЬwe know that climate change is real. тАЭ A police officer patrolling the rally pumped his fists in agreement. тАЬWe also believe that immigration makes this country a stronger country,тАЭ Ms. Warren said. тАЬWe will not build a stupid wall and we will not tear millions of families apart. тАЭ тАЬYou know, I could do this all day,тАЭ she added, to laughs and cheers. тАЬBut we gotta march. тАЭ Jess Bidgood _____ Notable Signs: тАЬBend toward justice,тАЭ evokeing the work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. тАЬIтАЩm ready to march again,тАЭ said Mr. Lewis, a Democratic representative of Georgia, who chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s. тАЬIтАЩve come here to say to you: DonтАЩt let anybody, anybody, turn you around. тАЭ Citing the demonstrations across the country, Mr. Lewis urged marchers, who flowed onto the street running near the Center for Civil and Human Rights, to тАЬuse this unity to organizeтАЭ future political efforts. тАЭThe next election, we must get out and vote like we never, ever voted before,тАЭ said Mr. Lewis, who was embroiled in a public clash with Mr. Trump recently. Alan Blinder _____ The crowds appeared to be huge in most places, with marchers in Washington, New York City and Chicago seeming to stretch to the horizons. Police departments, at times, decline to provide crowd estimates, and crowds are notoriously hard to estimate, even with a good satellite image. But some official and unofficial estimates have given a sense of the turnout. Attendance in New York City was more than 400, 000, according to Mayor Bill de BlasioтАЩs office. The St. Paul police issued an official crowd count of 50, 000 to 60, 000 people. Attendance in Boston was 175, 000, according to Nicole Caravella, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The Atlanta Police Department estimated about 60, 000 people attended a rally there. The Department of Public Safety in Phoenix estimated that some 20, 000 marched, while in Key West, Fla. a town of 25, 000, police said more than 2, 000 people marched. Organizers in Chicago estimated the crowd there at 250, 000, the Chicago Tribune said. The Office of Emergency Management and Communications there said late on Saturday morning that Grant Park, the sprawling area where the   had gathered, had been filled to capacity. Though the official march was canceled, many still chose to walk through downtown holding protest signs. Although the mayorтАЩs office in Washington and organizers declined to provide an estimate of the size of the flagship march, The Associated Press reported that the District of ColumbiaтАЩs homeland security director, Christopher Geldart, said it was safe to say the crowd at the march there was more than the 500, 000 that organizers told city officials to expect. тАЬThe crowd was so heavy, we didnтАЩt know which way to go,тАЭ said Sabitha   a psychotherapist who traveled to Washington from Philadelphia with her    child, Sanji, and a friend, Pallavi Sreedhar. тАЬWe were squeezed, touching. тАЭ (March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 тАЬsisterтАЭ marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated.) _____ Overheard Chant: тАЬYes we canтАЭ as people walked past the White House. As the sun set downtown, protesters made their way to the White House and assembled in small groups in a park just across from the buildingтАЩs entrance. There in an area surrounded by temporary gates, people walked single file through one open entrance and one by one laid protest signs across gates set up for inauguration several hundred feet away from the White House. While the temporary gates made walking up to the building impossible, people stood shaking their heads in frustration. Fontella Garraway, a    retired Army veteran who drove three and half hours from her home in Rocky Mount, N. C. sat on a bench staring at the White House with a pin that read тАЬgirl power. тАЭ тАЬEven looking at the White House, itтАЩs like I hope heтАЩs looking out here at us,тАЭ she said of Mr. Trump. тАЬI hope itтАЩs penetrating to him that we mean business and we are serious. тАЭ Moments later she lay a handwritten sign that read тАЬLove trumps hate Hear our voice,тАЭ on the a fence facing the White House. тАЭThatтАЩs his inauguration gift,тАЭ she said. Yamiche Alcindor _____ Notable Chant: тАЬTell me what America looks like! This is what America looks like. тАЭ Notable Sash: тАЬ65, 855, 610 votes for a woman,тАЭ worn by Sara Powell, 61, of Phoenix, and nine of her friends. Overheard: тАЬMy arms are tired. This is a good workout,тАЭ said Rima Borgogni, 50, owner of a Pilates studio in Sedona, Ariz. after holding a sign throughout the   march. Ellen Ferreira and her friends felt as if they were fighting for some of the same things they used to. They are mostly retired and many of them are veterans of past protests, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his тАЬI Have a DreamтАЭ speech. тАЬFor our right to choose,тАЭ said Piya Jacob, 70, a retired elementary school principal. тАЬFor equality,тАЭ said Mary Helsaple, 67, an artist. тАЬFor healing justice,тАЭ said Gretchen Vorbeck, 72, who runs a nonprofit that buys grocery gift cards for public schoolteachers. Carol Decker, 70, a retired magazine publisher, jumped in and said, тАЬWeтАЩre mad as hell and weтАЩre not going to take it anymore. тАЭ Fernanda Santos _____ Notable Chants: тАЬWe are the popular vote!тАЭ Notable Shirt: A blue shirt with тАЬMake Sexism Wrong AgainтАЭ in the same style as тАЬMake America Great AgainтАЭ campaign shirts. Just off 15th street, a block north of the paradeтАЩs official end point, a large flatbed float with big тАЬTRUMPтАЭ letters arched along the back parked itself in the middle of the street, drawing the ire of the thousands of marchers, who berated the float with chants of тАЬShame!тАЭ and тАЬWe are the popular vote!тАЭ Police officers formed a barricade around the float with more than a   sidecar motorcycles. The six or so men and one woman on the float all took pictures of the protesters. Yet some of those who chanted to chase the float away werenтАЩt surprised at its appearance at their march. тАЬI mean the inauguration was yesterday,тАЭ said Chrissy Fiore, 39, of Washington, though she said it was тАЬcrazy that they made it down here and that now theyтАЩre getting police escorted out. тАЭ Officers wouldnтАЩt let reporters approach those on the float or those driving it, but a magnet on the side said тАЬTrump Unity Bridge. тАЭ As the float headed east to move away from the parade, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a Trump supporter, was seen walking along the sidewalk, taking in the scene but remaining silent. He did not respond to a reporterтАЩs question about his opinion of the march or protest. Nick Corasaniti _____ Chant: тАЬDonтАЩt take away our ACAтАЭ and тАЬWhoтАЩs the boss? We are!тАЭ Notable Signs: тАЬShow us your taxesтАЭ тАЬyou canтАЩt comb over sexismтАЭ тАЬ1459 daysтАЭ and тАЬbuild a bridge not a wall. тАЭ Overheard: One woman speaking at the rally told the story of having an abortion when she was young, making the minimum wage and could not support a child. She said she was fighting for equal pay тАЬnot just for white women. тАЭ At the rally in Mr. TrumpтАЩs hometown near Trump World Tower, elected officials and celebrities assailed the president. Signs in the crowd mocked his bouffant hair and the size of his hands. The actress Whoopi Goldberg said it would be the first of many protests against the president. тАЬThis is how people ended the war in Vietnam,тАЭ Ms. Goldberg told the cheering crowd. Grace Huezo, 20, a student at Hunter College, marched with her twin sister holding a тАЬNasty WomanтАЭ sign. She said she was there to defend womenтАЩs rights after she was appalled by Mr. TrumpтАЩs comments about grabbing women. тАЬWeтАЩre here saying, no, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,тАЭ she said. She said she was buoyed by the huge turnout and the camaraderie. тАЬIтАЩm hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and theyтАЩre keeping their spirit,тАЭ she said. тАЬWeтАЩre all just going to stick together over the next four years. тАЭ Emma G. Fitzsimmons _____ Popular chant: тАЬMarch! March! March!тАЭ Notable signs: тАЬI wonтАЩt stop til it rains glassтАЭ тАЬYou canтАЩt comb over misogynyтАЭ (accompanied by a drawing of Mr. TrumpтАЩs hair) тАЬFlunk the Electoral College. тАЭ Overheard: тАЬI got to bring my high school punk rock out,тАЭ said Emily Hastings, 39, a woman from Denver wearing a black тАЬeat the richтАЭ   and carrying a тАЬDonтАЩt tread on womenтАЭ sign. тАЬPunk rock is all about resistance. тАЭ The march began in a park at the center of the city with a group singing тАЬYouтАЩve got a friend. тАЭ Marchers blanketed the park nestled between the   state capitol and city hall, hauling strollers, wearing pink hats and often hugging and kissing. Julie Turkewitz _____ Notable Sign: тАЬMake America Compassionate Again,тАЭ and тАЬI Love YouтАЭ Thousands of demonstrators gathered on a drizzly morning clad in rain boots, ponchos and pink knit тАЬpussyhatsтАЭ to march to the Capitol. тАЬWhat Trump has said is so based on exclusion and winning and being right versus taking care of everyone,тАЭ said Hilary James, 27, a musician from Minneapolis. тАЬEven if he doesnтАЩt listen to us, I feel itтАЩs important to not sit back. тАЭ Christina Capecchi _____ Notable Sign: Make America Think Again Gloria Cole, 66, had turned the protest into a family affair, traveling here with her wife, her daughter, her daughterтАЩs boyfriend, and her brother and   . тАЬI drew a line, itтАЩs like, IтАЩm an old woman  тАФ   IтАЩm not that old, IтАЩm 66  тАФ   I have to stand up for equal rights for everyone, for human rights,тАЭ Ms. Cole said. тАЬWeтАЩre here, and weтАЩre not going away. тАЭ Aili Shaw, 14, held a white sign that read, тАЬOur arms are tired from holding these signs since the 1920s. тАЭ Ms. Shaw had traveled here, by train and car, with friends from her home in Coventry, R. I. тАЬWomen donтАЩt have the rights they should,тАЭ she said. Jess Bidgood _____ Popular Chant: тАЬThank You. тАЭ Women were chanting this to the organizers of the march as they kicked off the dayтАЩs events. Notable Clothing: At the corner of C and Third Southwest, many women (and some men) were wearing   тАЬpussyhatsтАЭ of all shades of pink. Organizers wanted to knit as many as one million hats for this event. People were also getting creative with the signs they carry. Alan and Alison Lewis drove in from Astoria with their    Grace. тАЬYou shouldnтАЩt have to have a relationship to a woman to stand up for women,тАЭ Mr. Lewis said. тАЬEquality and justice is enough of a reason to be here. тАЭ Katie Rogers _____ Who She Is: Jessica Coleman, 56, of Stone Mountain, Ga. Backstory: A black retired teacher who used to show her daughter documentaries about black history and march with her daughter and church members during Martin Luther King holiday weekends. тАЬI wanted them to know you can be a smart, intelligent black person. You donтАЩt have to sag your pants and follow certain things that became media culture. I wanted them to know that people marched, bled and died for us to be able to vote and be able to go to college and have certain jobs. тАЭ тАЬYou can really lose your sense of self if you donтАЩt know where youтАЩve come from and you donтАЩt have a vision of where you want to go. тАЭ _____ Who She Is: Amber   34, of Bethesda, Md. is Ms. ColemanтАЩs daughter Backstory: Works at a nonprofit focused on civic education тАЬOn the evening of election night, after saying, тАШHey, IтАЩm going to vote and IтАЩm going to get my friends to vote,тАЩ I sat on the sofa bawling trying to figure out what to say to my daughters the next morning because they went to bed certain that Hillary was going to win. тАЭ тАЬMarching is my way of putting my money where my mouth is as far as being an active citizen. тАЭ тАЬI want my daughters to have agency and have control over their bodies and feel comfortable in the country that they are in so this is my way of saying, тАШHey everybody, I agree with all the people who are out here for different reasons and we donтАЩt agree with what is happening right now and we are taking a stand. тАЩтАЭ _____ Who She Is: Garvey Mortley, 8, of Bethesda, Md. is Ms. ColemanтАЩs granddaughter Backstory: Third grader was named after Marcus Garvey тАЬI think itтАЩs good to share the moment with them and help protest Donald Trump because we want to stand up for our rights because a long time ago, lots of women could not vote. Now we can vote and protest people and stuff. тАЭ тАЬIf he affects the world in a bad way  тАФ   like I have lots of friends from different countries and he could make them all move away   тАж     that makes me mad because all the people from the civil rights movement had a hard time trying to put us together. ItтАЩs like a puzzle, all these people came together, piece by piece, and now Donald Trump is coming over and just breaking those puzzle pieces. тАЭ
485	тАЬOne of the great weapons of a democracy. тАЭ This was how Harry Belafonte, the performer and civil rights activist, referred to the street march in a recent interview. Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills. He is also a   of the womenтАЩs march set for Saturday. When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend, they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital. From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Marian B. Mollin, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements, said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater, attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals. But the test of a marchтАЩs   efficacy, she said, is whether it energizes participants long after theyтАЩve gone home, sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change. This is what sheтАЩll be watching for in the months after SaturdayтАЩs march. тАЬAre they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Because there is a lot of unfun, unglamorous work to do,тАЭ she said. We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed  тАФ   or didnтАЩt change  тАФ   history. On March 3, 1913, a    named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots, threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest womenтАЩs march in American history. Behind her came businesswomen in blue, writers in white, artists in pink and musicians in red, all calling for their right to vote. Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them. тАЬIf my wife were where you are,тАЭ a police officer told one woman, according to this newspaper, тАЬIтАЩd break her head. тАЭ   Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. By the end, more than 100 women were hospitalized. Women had fought for suffrage since at least 1848. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. By 1920, American women had the right to vote. Read how The New York Times covered the march here. On July 28, 1932, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington, wheeled tanks into position, prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperse. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the   marches in American history. The law had said payments would be made in 1945, but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier. The event lasted weeks, until President Herbert Hoover ordered the protestersтАЩ removal. Army troops shot тАЬa heavy barrage of tear gasтАЭ at the veterans, according to The Times. Two people died during the protest. In тАЬThe Bonus Army: An American Epic,тАЭ the authors Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen wrote that the march changed the nation, pushing Congress to pass the G. I. Bill, landmark legislation that allowed many veterans to go to college. Read how The Times covered the march here. The National Mall swelled with people on Aug. 28, 1963, to urge Congress to pass a historic civil rights bill. It was here that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his тАЬI Have a DreamтАЭ speech. тАЬAs he arose, a great roar welled up from the crowd,тАЭ the journalist E. W. Kenworthy wrote in The Times. тАЬWhen he started to speak, a hush fell. тАЭ The paper reported that more than 200, 000 people had attended. At the time, civil rights legislation was tied up in Congress, facing a filibuster by Southern lawmakers. But the march helped energize everyday people like Hazel Mangle Rivers, a black woman who took the $8 overnight bus to Washington from her home in Birmingham, Ala. тАЬWhen I get back there tomorrow IтАЩm going to do whatever needs to be done,тАЭ she told a Times reporter after the protest. тАЬI donтАЩt care if itтАЩs picketing or marching or   or what, IтАЩm ready to do it. тАЭ The gathering was followed by sustained activism  тАФ   including a   drive in Mississippi and a march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery  тАФ   that helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The march, Mr. Belafonte said recently, showed that there was тАЬa great swatch of American opinion that was supportive of our cause. тАЭ Read how The Times covered the march here. On Nov. 15, 1969, antiwar activists streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue, calling for a rapid withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Three drummers led the procession, followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead. Then came rows and rows of marchers, 17 abreast, shouting, тАЬPeace now! Peace now!тАЭ A police official estimated the crowd to be at least 250, 000 strong, though others have said it was much larger. At the time, many Americans had grown impatient with President Richard NixonтАЩs policy of gradual withdrawal. The White House said the president had spent the day watching college football inside. It was the largest antiwar protest to date. But its success was less clear than the 1963 civil rights gathering. тАЬIn the aftermath of that march, Nixon escalates the war,тАЭ Professor Mollin said. Read how The Times covered the march here. The Supreme CourtтАЩs decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a womanтАЩs right to an abortion, spurred anger across the country, particularly among religious and conservative families. A year after Roe v. Wade, on Jan. 22, 1974, thousands gathered in Washington to urge Congress to support a constitutional amendment, known as the Buckley Amendment, which would have effectively overturned the decision. When it became clear it wouldnтАЩt happen that year, the marchтАЩs founder, Nellie Gray, vowed to hold marches every year until it did. This yearтАЩs march, to be held on Jan. 27, will include a particularly prominent speaker: Kellyanne Conway, the   woman in the Trump administration. Read how The Times covered the march here. Andy Humm was a television reporter for the Gay Cable Network on Oct. 11, 1987, when an estimated 200, 000 people gathered in Washington to call for AIDS research and the end of discrimination against gay people. (The event followed a 1979 march, before the AIDS crisis.) By 1987, more than 20, 000 Americans had died of AIDS and an additional 36, 000 had learned they had the disease, which was deeply stigmatizing. Activists were desperate for research and care. They spread a quilt bearing names of the dead. And they wept as Mr. Humm interviewed them. тАЬThere was no hope,тАЭ he said in a recent conversation. тАЬWe were a fairly powerless movement back then. тАЭ The march helped mobilize and personalize the movement.

Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them black men, came together on Oct. 16, 1995, for a rally organized by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He called on them to тАЬaccept the responsibilityтАЭ to тАЬbe good husbands and fathers and builders of our community. тАЭ It was contentious  тАФ   Mr. Farrakhan had been criticized previously for sexist and   remarks  тАФ   and was attended by the poet Maya Angelou but opposed by the N.

But the marchтАЩs legacy is the subject of debate. тАЬSome say its core message of   and atonement left black men grappling alone with issues such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, letting politicians and institutions off the hook,тАЭ a Washington Post reporter wrote. тАЬOthers argue that the earnest assembly was a potent symbol that changed perceptions of black men and inspired the marchers to make great changes in their lives. тАЭ In 2015, Mr. Farrakhan held a second march. Much of the discussion centered on the use of force by the police and continued discrimination. Art Scott, 59, a salesman who attended, told The Times: тАЬThere comes a time, after being pushed for so long, to push back. I think thatтАЩs the feeling in the black community right now. тАЭ Read how The New York Times covered the march.
486	SOFIA, Bulgaria  тАФ   The inaugural meeting of the European Trump Society packed the central aisle of a bookstore in BulgariaтАЩs capital, Sofia, on Friday evening  тАФ   women in furs, men in ski jackets, the floor glistening with melted snow. A live feed from the crowded steps of the United States Capitol filled a projection screen on the back wall. тАЬThe election of Mr. Trump means тАШYouтАЩre fired!тАЩ to the political elites in America and the world,тАЭ declared Boris Angelov, a tabloid editor and a founder of the society, which is strictly Bulgarian at the moment but has wider aspirations. Ilia Lingorski, a former deputy finance minister, shouted from the crowd, тАЬBulgaria desperately needs its own Trump movement. тАЭ The inauguration of Donald J. Trump as AmericaтАЩs 45th president, with declarations of тАЬAmerica first,тАЭ was met with alarm in many corners of the world. But not everywhere. Pockets of celebration broke out here and there, in places where Mr. TrumpтАЩs nationalist message matched local stirrings, and his promise of friendlier relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a harsher approach to Islamic terrorism were eagerly embraced. About 100 Trump supporters gathered around a statue of President Ronald Reagan in BudapestтАЩs Freedom Square for a тАЬBetter World Order Inauguration Party. тАЭ The speaker was Zsolt Bayer, a prominent   pundit who once referred to Jews as тАЬstinking excrement. тАЭ Standing beneath a banner reading тАЬHungarian Deplorables for Trump,тАЭ he called on President Trump to combat political correctness, which Mr. Bayer said had created a world in which тАЬonly the white, Christian, heterosexual people do not matter. тАЭ тАЬFor decades, we have been waiting for a miracle that will stop our world from running to its demise,тАЭ Mr. Bayer said. тАЬNow, we are hopeful that this miracle is in the making. тАЭ Mr. TrumpтАЩs support in Hungary rises beyond the small group in Freedom Square. The countryтАЩs prime minister, Viktor Orban, eagerly congratulated the new president on his victory. In Moscow, a chain of stores selling Russian military gear offered a   10 percent discount on Friday to all United States citizens and embassy workers. A poster advertising the sale featured a   Mr. Trump, fist raised. Several celebratory parties were held in Moscow before and after Mr. TrumpтАЩs inauguration. At one, the crowd sang, тАЬTrump, Trump, he is a superhuman. тАЭ Another featured a triptych of heroic portraits of Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump and the French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen. A group of Russian gunsmiths unveiled a commemorative coin declaring тАЬIn Trump We Trust,тАЭ and Life News, a Russian tabloid, reported that Mr. Trump had been declared an honorary Cossack. Political activists, media figures and dozens of foreign journalists gathered on Friday evening at a conference site just outside the Kremlin for a celebration of Mr. TrumpтАЩs inauguration, an event organized by conservative activists and a conservative television channel. Maria Katasonova, one of the organizers, declined to say who had paid for the spacious hall, meat pies and sparkling wine. тАЬIt wasnтАЩt the Kremlin,тАЭ she said. Although the event pushed a sense of triumphalism, the mood among the audience was more skeptical. Many said they worried that тАЬ  elitesтАЭ in Washington would stymie Mr. TrumpтАЩs efforts. тАЬThis is the last day we can celebrate,тАЭ said Dmitri Gusev, a Russian political consultant. тАЬBecause tomorrow, real life will begin. тАЭ Mr. TrumpтАЩs ascent was also cheered by President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. His spokesman, Martin Andanar, said the two men had тАЬhit it offтАЭ in a brief conversation, leading to a likely тАЬrebootтАЭ in relations between the two nations. Ben Razon, an American of Filipino descent who runs a restaurant in Manila, said of Mr. Trump, тАЬI do hope that he establishes a good working relationship with President Duterte. тАЭ тАЬThey understand each other,тАЭ Mr. Razon added. тАЬThat should be good. тАЭ In India, where the right wing shares a strong political affinity with the American right, Mr. TrumpтАЩs inauguration was celebrated by Hindu nationalists and business leaders eager for more trade between the two nations. Hindu Sena, a   fringe group, organized a celebration of Mr. TrumpтАЩs victory on Nov. 4  тАФ   four days before he actually won  тАФ   and had earlier held a prayer ritual on his behalf. тАЬTrumpтАЩs victory is confirmed early due to his thoughts against Islamic terrorism and love for India and Hindus,тАЭ the groupтАЩs leader, Vishnu Gupta, said, according to Reuters. In Egypt, support for Mr. Trump remained fervent among the countryтАЩs   establishment. Hany Assal, a columnist for the     newspaper, sharply criticized American liberals and Democrats for opposing Mr. Trump. тАЬThey are putting obstacles in his way,тАЭ he wrote, including тАЬtrying to start fights with Russia for no reason. тАЭ On the street,     sentiment seemed to fuel a more subdued attitude toward the new president. тАЬSome people think he is going to be bad because he is openly   but the truth is, America has always been against Islam,тАЭ said Bashir Kashta, a Palestinian businessman, as he sipped mint tea on Friday at the historic El Fishawy Cafe in CairoтАЩs old Islamic district. Samy Abdel Mageed, 56, an engineer smoking a water pipe at an adjacent table, said he had тАЬnot met a single person who is excited about Trump or thinks he will change anything for better or worse. тАЭ тАЬAmerica is a country of institutions, and institutions are hard to change,тАЭ he said. At the bookstore party in Bulgaria, Borislav Tsekov, another founder of the European Trump Society, proudly surveyed the crowd of about 75 people who had trudged through   slush to attend the event at the Greenwich Book Center. He described the society as a scholarly organization dedicated to studying Mr. TrumpтАЩs ideas. Mr. Tsekov, a former lawmaker who has been a member of several political parties, used the gathering to unveil his latest book, тАЬThe Trump Doctrine,тАЭ a study of the new presidentтАЩs speeches and writings. Speaking before Mr. Trump was sworn in, Mr. Tsekov criticized the mainstream news media and the global political establishment, saying that they had unfairly portrayed Mr. Trump as a racist and xenophobe. тАЬWell, isnтАЩt he?тАЭ cried a voice from the crowd that was then shouted down. Mr. Tsekov was not able to listen to Mr. TrumpтАЩs speech on the big screen. He was too busy giving television interviews. But he said he looked forward to reading it and was certain he would approve. His   Mr. Angelov, was delighted with the turnout and looked forward to fresh branches sprouting across Europe. тАЬTrump is very popular in Bulgaria,тАЭ Mr. Angelov said. тАЬHe is a brand, you know? He is an international brand. тАЭ
487	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Hours after President Trump took his oath on Friday, the Justice Department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law. In a   opinion signed on Friday, a longtime career lawyer in the Justice DepartmentтАЩs Office of Legal Counsel said that the presidentтАЩs special hiring authority exempted White House positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency. Some legal experts had raised concerns that Mr. KushnerтАЩs appointment violated that law, which Congress enacted several years after President John F. Kennedy had appointed his brother Robert as attorney general. But the new Justice Department opinion, signed by Daniel L. Koffsky, a deputy assistant attorney general in the legal counsel office, said Mr. Trump had the power to appoint Mr. Kushner anyway because of a subsequent 1978 law that gives the president the authority to appoint White House staff members without regard to other laws restricting employment and compensation of federal employees. Mr. KoffskyтАЩs opinion acknowledged that in several cases since 1978, the Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the antinepotism statute prevented presidents from appointing relatives to positions. тАЬAlthough our conclusion today departs from some of that prior work, we think that this departure is fully justified,тАЭ he wrote. The revised position came after an effort by Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. KushnerтАЩs lawyer and a deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration who is now a lawyer at the firm WilmerHale, to clear away obstacles to Mr. KushnerтАЩs appointment. The opinion paves the way for Mr. Kushner, 35, to join Mr. Trump in the West Wing. Among the new presidentтАЩs closest advisers during the campaign, Mr. Kushner married Mr. TrumpтАЩs daughter Ivanka in 2009. He has run his familyтАЩs vast real estate company and has owned a newspaper, The New York Observer. Mr. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that he would appoint Mr. Kushner, who will not accept a salary. His purview is expected to include the Middle East and Israel, government partnerships with the private sector and matters involving free trade. тАЬIf you canтАЩt produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,тАЭ Mr. Trump said to Mr. Kushner at an event on Thursday. The appointment of Mr. Kushner will be a dramatic change. In 1977, for example, the Justice Department barred President Jimmy Carter from appointing his son to an unpaid White House role, citing the antinepotism law. Even after Congress enacted the 1978 law, the Justice Department continued to block proposed appointments of presidential relatives. Mr. KoffskyтАЩs opinion, which he worked on in the final days of the Obama administration, acknowledged a 1983 case in which the office barred President Ronald Reagan from appointing a relative to an advisory committee, and a 2009 case in which it blocked President Barack Obama from appointing his    and a half sister to advisory committees. But, Mr. Koffsky maintained, those opinions failed to adequately address the impact of the special hiring authority that Congress gave the president for his personal staff as part of the 1978 law. He also wrote that it was unlikely that Congress could bar a president from obtaining informal, ad hoc policy advice from a relative, and a major consequence of allowing Mr. KushnerтАЩs appointment to a formal role is that he will be subject to the usual ethics rules for White House employees, like    laws. Mr. Kushner intends to sell some assets to his brother and to put others into a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who has worked on the plan. Ms. Gorelick said she had been consulting with federal ethics officials to try to address any    issues associated with Mr. KushnerтАЩs appointment. He will also be required to file a financial disclosure report that details his assets and income, and to divest some holdings that could create a conflict of interest. When Mr. Trump announced Mr. KushnerтАЩs appointment, Ms. Gorelick told reporters that while there were arguments on both sides of the legal question, she believed the тАЬbetter argumentтАЭ was that it would be lawful. She also disclosed then that the Trump transition team would seek an Office of Legal Counsel opinion. In an email on Saturday, Ms. Gorelick said that тАЬwe believed that we had the better argument on this,тАЭ adding that тАЬthe Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department  тАФ   in an opinion by a highly regarded career deputy assistant attorney general  тАФ   adopted a position consistent with our own. тАЭ Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while he had some doubts about the new opinion, тАЬit is a reasonable interpretationтАЭ of the law. тАЬBut what is important now,тАЭ he added, тАЬis that Mr. Kushner complies with the    and disclosure provisions, and I wish his    the president, would do the same. тАЭ
488	WASHINGTON  тАФ   One topic has dominated conversations among elected Republicans since President TrumpтАЩs stunning victory: Will he actually pursue his campaign agenda of   nationalism, all but obliterating the   distinctions that have defined AmericaтАЩs political parties for a century? While some of his advisers suggested that he would slip back into a more conventional Republican approach, Mr. Trump dropped hints in interviews, Twitter posts and other public comments that he intended to push his party away from its   internationalist dogma on trade, foreign alliances, immigration, infrastructure spending and prescription drug access. The hints are over. An inaugural speech delivered with the same blunt force that propelled Mr. TrumpтАЩs insurgent campaign has dashed Republican hopes for a more traditional agenda. With his тАЬnew decree,тАЭ he declared himself modern AmericaтАЩs first populist president  тАФ   and all but dared his own party to resist his Republican reformation. тАЬEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,тАЭ he said. Mr. TrumpтАЩs vision will inevitably collide with establishment Republican leaders in Congress, and the outcome could determine not just the success of Mr. TrumpтАЩs presidency, but also the identity of his party. Republicans have resisted Democratic efforts to spend big on the nationтАЩs roads, bridges, tunnels and rail lines use the federal governmentтАЩs power to bargain for lower prescription drug prices block trade agreements and limit foreign interventions. Republican leaders have sought a   approach on immigration laws, offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and tried to restrain popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. If the president is able to blur party lines on such issues and harness an ascendant   coalition to win that clash, he will have untethered conservatism from the Republican Party and shifted the party away from the   approach that has been its hallmark since Ronald Reagan stood 36 years ago in the same position on the Capitol steps as Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump is about to discover that his hopes for a realignment may not come easily. As in his campaign, he faces an array of obstacles: his historic unpopularity and lack of discipline, advisers who hope to nudge him back toward conventional Republicanism and, perhaps most significant, other party leaders who have a more conservative outlook on domestic policy and government spending and a more hawkish attitude on foreign affairs. The alarm and anxiety within the Republican PartyтАЩs congressional wing toward its own president are remarkable. And among Mr. TrumpтАЩs most outspoken intraparty critics, the warnings of resistance are unambiguous. тАЬThere are three branches of government,тАЭ said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. тАЬWe now have a majority in both houses. And both majorities I think hold to basic conservative Republican principles. тАЭ   the threat of reprisal, Mr. McCain said he intended to be true to what he saw as his party and his voters: тАЬTrump carried Arizona by four points. I carried my state by 14 points. тАЭ Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who like Mr. McCain has repeatedly clashed with Mr. Trump, said that he was preparing for the president to back his opponent in a primary next year  тАФ   but that it would not dissuade him from putting up opposition on some issues. тАЬThere are some of us who will be pushing to get back to the roots of the party: limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, free trade,тАЭ Mr. Flake said. тАЬThose are things that the party has stood on for a long time. тАЭ Mr. Trump and some of his closest advisers say such resistance is not just futile but foolish. And they are already pledging to harness Mr. TrumpтАЩs following in the states and districts of recalcitrant Republicans to sound warnings of their own. тАЬThe incentive for many of these members will be to follow Mr. TrumpтАЩs lead because he won many of their states,тАЭ said Kellyanne Conway, the presidentтАЩs campaign chief turned senior White House adviser. Aiming at perhaps the most powerful congressional Republican, and one of the more orthodox conservatives, Ms. Conway pointedly recalled Speaker Paul D. RyanтАЩs inability to carry his own state in 2012 as the partyтАЩs   nominee. тАЬSpeaker Ryan knows   lost by seven points in Wisconsin, and Mr. Trump just won the state,тАЭ she said. As Ms. Conway noted, many Republican skeptics were doubtful that Mr. Trump could win in the first place. But even some on the right who are sympathetic to elements of his vision worry that there is no infrastructure to undergird and promote Trumpism  тАФ   unlike ReaganтАЩs conservative movement or former President Bill ClintonтАЩs centrist тАЬthird wayтАЭ approach. Traditional conservatives dominate Capitol Hill, WashingtonтАЩs think tanks and advocacy groups, as well as   statehouses. тАЬPopulism has been an energy that has carried Republicans into office, but once in office very few of them stay populist,тАЭ said Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the conservative Washington Free Beacon. Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review, said, тАЬI think itтАЩs likely that Trump is premature,тАЭ arguing that Mr. Trump is aligned with the partyтАЩs voters but a step ahead of its congressional wing. тАЬHe is only one man. тАЭ There are Republicans who still believe that Mr. Trump will govern more as a   conservative even as he attracts a broader coalition of   voters to the party. тАЬI donтАЩt think he is going to fundamentally reshape the party on issues,тАЭ predicted Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. He added that Mr. TrumpтАЩs political legacy would be to тАЬopen the eyesтАЭ of voters who had not supported Republican presidential hopefuls in recent years. Mr. Walker said Mr. Trump himself had said he was not тАЬa policy guyтАЭ and argued that the president would lean heavily on Vice President Mike Pence and the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to carry out his agenda. That is exactly what worries some Republicans who share Mr. TrumpтАЩs views: that the president will be undermined by some in his inner circle. When Mr. Trump veered away from orthodoxy during the transition, some of his advisers quickly tried to recast his comments with a more conservative veneer. тАЬMy concern with Reince is heтАЩs bringing in a lot of the   folks,тАЭ said Rick Santorum, a onetime senator from Pennsylvania, who ran a     campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. тАЬTheyтАЩre not fans of the agenda, much less real fans of Trump. тАЭ And, Mr. Santorum added of Mr. PenceтАЩs roots in traditional conservatism, тАЬcandidly this is not where Mike has been in the past, either. тАЭ Still, Mr. Santorum said, he spoke on the phone to Mr. Trump this past week, and the incoming president was every bit as committed to his style of politics as he was during the campaign. тАЬHeтАЩs not going to change,тАЭ Mr. Santorum said. Mr. TrumpтАЩs Inaugural Address reflected as much, and it highlighted the influence of the most prominent nationalists entering the West Wing this weekend, the senior advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller. The new president not only outlined his brand of politics, but also sent a message to those who work in the building behind him. тАЬWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action,тАЭ Mr. Trump said. тАЬThe time for empty talk is over. тАЭ Or as Ms. Conway put it, тАЬWhen he says, тАШWeтАЩre going to build the wall,тАЩ he means it, and when he says, тАШWeтАЩre going to renegotiate trade deals,тАЩ he means it. тАЭ тАЬ  or undercutting or trying to change Donald Trump is a foolтАЩs errand,тАЭ she added. тАЬPeople who watched this campaign should have discovered that by now. тАЭ
489	WASHINGTON  тАФ   President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessorтАЩs legacy and begin enacting his own agenda, his aides say, part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas. It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. тАЬItтАЩs going to be a   decision,тАЭ Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon. Then, around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act. тАЬThere are a number that are being looked at, but itтАЩs just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when,тАЭ Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. TrumpтАЩs top aides were still deciding on the тАЬsequencingтАЭ of the unilateral actions. Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. TrumpтАЩs sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying. In his first   in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack ObamaтАЩs signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administrationтАЩs unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. ObamaтАЩs use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the countryтАЩs ideological course. Aides said they hoped to group Mr. TrumpтАЩs executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend. Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do. If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA  тАФ   the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits. Ending that program would put as many as 800, 000 of them at risk of being removed from their families and sent to the countries they had left as children. The White House could instead unwind the program slowly, giving the young people, often called Dreamers, more time before their immigration protections and work permits expire. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on Friday that in a brief conversation with the new president, Mr. Trump had given him assurances about the program. The president, Mr. Durbin said, told him that тАЬwe donтАЩt want to hurt those kids weтАЩre going to do something. тАЭ тАЬThank goodness he said that,тАЭ the senator added. The president could also order federal agents to conduct workplace raids to crack down on immigration violations. He could take action against   sanctuary cities, those that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or he could issue an order reinstating a program known as Secure Communities, in which the local authorities cooperated with federal agencies to detect and deport illegal immigrants. And he could order work to begin, at least symbolically, on a wall at the southern border. Financing construction of the entire wall would require congressional action, however. But on the border wall and other promises, Mr. Trump now faces the challenge of translating slogans into action. He has already missed the deadline for a vow he made in August to start deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records on his first day in office. тАЬWe will begin moving them out, Day 1,тАЭ he said during a rally in Phoenix. тАЬMy first hour in office, those people are gone. тАЭ Mr. TrumpтАЩs approach to using his newly minted executive power mirrors his often chaotic transition to the White House. The    nature of the new presidentтАЩs first 24 hours reflected his management style, both in his business empire and in the campaign, which went through four   as aides fell into and out of favor. His travel schedule was rarely planned out more than a few days in advance, and Mr. Trump did not hesitate to tear it apart when he wanted to. Decisions would be telegraphed by top advisers, only to be pulled back within hours, or never formally announced. The lack of planning stands in stark contrast to the approaches of past presidents, who have sought to demonstrate the change in direction they hope to lead and maximize the effectiveness of their unilateral actions. Ronald Reagan retreated to the PresidentтАЩs Room just off the Senate floor only moments after being sworn in and signed an order freezing federal hiring, echoing the declaration in his inaugural address that тАЬgovernment is not the solution to our problem government is the problem. тАЭ Mr. Obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days, after a team of lawyers led by Gregory B. Craig, his first White House counsel, spent much of his transition planning what he could do without Congress to illustrate a stark break with George W. BushтАЩs presidency. On his second full day in office, Mr. Obama ordered the closing of the Guant├бnamo Bay prison  тАФ   a directive still unfulfilled  тАФ   and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the Army Field Manual. Mr. ObamaтАЩs embrace of executive orders  тАФ   early in the administration and later, when a   Congress blocked his legislative agenda  тАФ   may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump to take quick action. Since many of Mr. ObamaтАЩs achievements were put in place with executive action, Mr. Trump can reverse them, at least over time, the same way.
490	WASHINGTON  тАФ   In the end, she checked every box. Elegant, unexpected dress? Check. Unknown designer elevated to overnight sensation? Check. New York brand? Check. Implicit message about cooperation and embracing the melting pot? Check. When Melania Trump took the stage with her husband, President Trump, on Friday night for the inaugural balls, she demonstrated that, while she may have been out of the spotlight since the election, she hasnтАЩt been sticking her head in the sand. She has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress. In an architectural    white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt, a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt, she looked  тАФ   especially when compared with the younger generation of Trump women, most of whom opted for   sparkling princess gowns  тАФ   understated and adult. Not remotely mired in the 1980s, though her husbandтАЩs look and rhetoric may be. And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress, she cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world. The gown was, according to a statement from her office, a тАЬcollaborationтАЭ between Mrs. Trump and the designer Herv├й Pierre, a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera, where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, though largely behind the scenes. He left that post last February. This is his first major dress under his own name (he does not yet have a   collection in that context). It will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the Smithsonian stretching back to Helen Taft in 1909. Though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that Mrs. Trump was working with ChanelтАЩs creative director Karl Lagerfeld on her gown, in the end she used the opportunity  тАФ   and indeed, her entire inaugural wardrobe  тАФ   to do what her husband, standing on the steps of the Capitol building, said they would do: тАЬfollow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. тАЭ After over 20 years in this country, Mr. Pierre counts. Indeed, with one notable exception  тАФ   Kellyanne ConwayтАЩs       coat at the   which looked like she might have borrowed it off a toy soldier (it was her тАЬTrump revolution wearтАЭ she told reporters) but in fact turned out to be a $3, 600 design from the Italian brand Gucci  тАФ   the inaugural weekend overall was a series of America First fashion moments, literally and metaphorically. And not just when it came to the women. There has been a lot of speculation over whether the office of president will change Mr. Trump  тАФ   encourage moderation of his Twitter account, for example, or his language. As yet that is unclear, but it does appear to have changed how his family dresses. On Friday the president wore an overcoat and shirt to the   said to be by Brooks Brothers, the American menтАЩs wear brand that outfitted 39 presidents before him. Lincoln, Grant, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama wore Brooks Brothers for their   ceremonies, and Mr. Obama even wore his overcoat again on Friday when he stood with Mr. Trump. For a man who often overtly rejected the Washington establishment and what came before in his speech, it was nevertheless a nod to tradition and history. The day before, Melania Trump (who during the campaign tended toward European brands) stepped off the military jet that brought the Trumps to Washington for a   ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in a strict,     coat by Norisol Ferrari, a small, independent New York designer who described herself to WWD as a тАЬ  minority woman. тАЭ Then, that evening at the donorsтАЩ black tie dinner, the first lady wore a   nude sequined gown by Reem Acra, the   designer based in New York. And Ivanka Trump wore three different outfits from Oscar de la Renta, a   name of New York Fashion Week: a   coat and matching dress to Arlington a    gown to the donorтАЩs dinner and a white pantsuit to the  . (Oscar de la Renta himself dressed both Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush for their husbandsтАЩ second inaugural balls the brand is something of an inaugural  .) For the balls, she donned Carolina Herrera. It was when Mrs. Trump wore a Ralph Lauren     cashmere dress and coat to the Inauguration Day festivities, however, that it became indubitable that something strategic was going on. It is not just because Mr. Lauren is a designer who has built an empire on the mythology of the American dream, or because he has outfitted the U. S. Olympic team and donated $13 million to help restore the   Banner at the National Museum of American History. And it is not because he had dressed four first ladies before, crossing political parties in service to the role. It is because the dress and coat he made for Mrs. Trump, in shape and shade, created an image that was redolent of nothing so much as Jacqueline Kennedy at her Camelot inaugural, with all the new beginnings and freighted history that implies. Whatever you think of the reality of that connection  тАФ   and on social media, there was a lot of verbal    тАФ   the outfit oozed appropriateness. If it looked like something of a first lady costume, and it did, it also suggested that Mrs. Trump had studied up and was prepared to assume the starring role she played later in the evening. Just as Ivanka TrumpтАЩs trouser suit, which was designed by Fernando Garcia, one half of the new young creative duo at Oscar de la Renta, seemed a sign of the unofficial role she has often suggested she will pursue: womenтАЩs advocate. White pantsuits, after all, became famous over the summer when Hillary Clinton wore one, also by Ralph Lauren, to accept the Democratic nomination for president, at least in part in acknowledgment of the suffragists, who chose white as one of their signature colors. Later, the white outfits were adopted as a uniform of sorts by   women as they went to the polls. It was thus a fairly pointed (and, to some, poignant) moment when Mrs. Clinton appeared in a final white Ralph Lauren pantsuit to accompany her husband to the inauguration  тАФ   a suit that had been made as part of her campaign collaboration with Mr. Lauren, but never worn. And it was probably not by chance that Ms. Trump selected a similar look. The politics of clothing may be subtle, and may strike some as frivolous, but that doesnтАЩt mean they arenтАЩt a requisite part of the pageantry that surrounds the presidency  тАФ   especially on a day with more photo opportunities than speeches. They paint a picture of the family that now represents the country, of their ambitions, goals and values, at a moment when the world is watching. This time, the brush strokes swirled: not with accessibility, but with aspiration, and nationalism. A case of the emperorтАЩs new clothes, or a harbinger of things to come? WeтАЩll have to keep looking to find out.
491	WASHINGTON  тАФ   The glorious Lincoln Memorial was closed on Inauguration Day, leaving its white marble inhabitant to inspire from a distance. The monument had served as a backdrop for an inaugural concert the night before, and now, in the late morning, construction workers were methodically removing the silvery bars of scaffolding that imprisoned it. Even so, its sole resident could still be seen behind the Doric columns, his gaze trained on the   domed Capitol, where a peaceful transfer of power was about to take place. And people still came to be in his presence, some to remind themselves that a country riven by dissent can come together. It has before. No matter that the sky was as gray as the Potomac, or that the cold air felt like a wet sweater. Here they were, from the North and South, East and West, in red Trump hats and blue Hillary   jubilant, distressed, feeling a part and apart. They stood in admiration of Lincoln, as workers tore down and cleaned up, including a man collecting debris with a   picker, his dog tag laced securely into one of his   boots. Ed Rich, he said his name was, while taking a Camel break.   years old. A mortgage broker from Annapolis, trying to ride out a slow period. So itтАЩs $12 an hour working for the inauguration, putting up fencing, laying down flooring, snapping up cigarette butts with a metal picker. тАЬI voted for him,тАЭ Mr. Rich said of Donald J. Trump, at this point still the  . тАЬI think he could make a mess of it, but it could be cleaned up easily. People seem to forget thereтАЩs a House and a Senate. тАЭ Mr. Rich tossed his spent cigarette into the box of garbage he was carrying and returned to collecting butts and paper bits, his words nowhere near as eloquent as those of Lincoln, carved into the memorialтАЩs walls, yet in the same vein: the belief  тАФ   often tested, including on this day  тАФ   in the countryтАЩs democratic system of governance. Generations have come to the Lincoln Memorial to reassure themselves  тАФ   or to remind the rest of the nation  тАФ   of this foundational belief. The   contralto, Marian Anderson, sang here in 1939, after the Daughters of the American Revolution had barred her from another Washington venue she began with тАЬMy country тАЩtis of thee, sweet land of liberty. тАЭ The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of course, delivered his тАЬI Have a DreamтАЭ speech here in 1963, after Mahalia Jackson called out, тАЬTell them about the dream, Martin. тАЭ Even Richard M. Nixon, during a dark moment of his presidency (and that is saying something) came here on a very early May morning in 1970, valet in tow he wound up in profoundly strange conversations with some Vietnam War protesters, his disjointed message: DonтАЩt give up on this country. In their footsteps came others on this inaugural morning. Jerry Naradzay, 56, a physician from Henderson, N. C. cycled up to the monument with his    son, Sammy, the fatherтАЩs broad smile explained by his red тАЬMake America Great AgainтАЭ cap. He noted that the memorialтАЩs stone had come from both the North and the South to convey unity after division. He then said he had goose bumps just thinking of more than two centuries of peaceful transfers of power. Nodding toward the memorial, Dr. Naradzay said, тАЬThis monument represents how the country is bigger than one man. тАЭ Standing nearby in full agreement were four Hillary Clinton supporters from WisconsinтАЩs North Country. They had made plans for this Washington visit in expectation of a different result, but decided to come anyway, in part to participate in the womenтАЩs march on Saturday. So: How did they feel? тАЬHollow,тАЭ said Jackie Moore, 33, a member of the Ashland City Council. Several awkward seconds of silence followed. When conversation resumed, another Ashland council member, David Mettille, 32, and his partner, Teege Mettille, 36, recounted how their blue Hillary shirts had spurred some heckling, but they didnтАЩt mind. It was their way of saying: WeтАЩre still here. тАЬWe will remember this,тАЭ David Mettille said. тАЬWe will remember how painful today is, so that four years from now  тАФ   we work to win. тАЭ Then Teege Mettille noted that they had about a   left of President Obama, and off the visitors from Ashland went. It was true: Time was winding down, or winding up. From the   ceremony in the distance, beyond the reflecting poolтАЩs greenish waters, came the echoes of ministers beseeching God for guidance, the raised voices of the Missouri State University Chorale, the somber tones of imminent transition. All the while, others came to be in LincolnтАЩs presence. A retired civil engineer from Virginia who said he had voted for Mr. Trump because a relative is a heroin addict, and because the Mexican border is a sieve. A couple from Utah who voted for Mr. Trump because their community depends on natural gas and oil. Mothers and their adult daughters from Texas and New Mexico, so dismayed that Mr. Trump would soon be their president that they kept their backs to the inauguration. Soon the Mormon Tabernacle Choir could be heard singing тАЬAmerica the Beautiful. тАЭ Then came the distinctive voice of the new president, his assertions of a restored American greatness in all things floating through the gray noon and up the four score and seven steps leading from the reflecting pool to the memorial. No longer   he was now President Trump. While the pageantry unfolded, Mr. Rich, the debris collector, kept working. A former Marine, he said he spent six months in Iraq with a mortuary affairs unit, collecting bodies and body parts from the front. Sometimes there wasnтАЩt enough for certain identification, he said, тАЬso youтАЩd write, тАШBelieved to be. тАЩтАЭ He said he was making plans to succeed again in the mortgage business, in a country whose   form of government he trusts. But for now Mr. Rich had what he called his mission, which was to keep the plaza beneath LincolnтАЩs gaze clean.
48	ItтАЩs that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the тАЬStocks to Buy for 2017. тАЭ Before you take them up on their suggestions, letтАЩs look at how well such portfolios did in 2016. The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all. The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend: Invest in a broad,   mutual index fund. (The TimesтАЩs тАЬYour MoneyтАЭ columnist wrote more on this here.) In 2016, the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent. But if you invested in ForbesтАЩs 2016 list, your money grew about 7 percent. KiplingerтАЩs was about half that. A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent, and BarronтАЩs returned 5. 3 percent. One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10. 6 percent. But VanguardтАЩs Total Stock index fund returned 12. 5 percent in the same period. We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested, but still none beat the widely owned index fund. There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating. There were some bona fide winners on almost every list: Goldman Sachs, Kennametal, Ellie Mae, Douglas Dynamics,   Burlington Stores. You might not have heard of some of those companies, so itтАЩs not a bad place to look for ideas. But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way. Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks. But as you can see, even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists, they donтАЩt do as well as the averages. The best advice remains the same: If you have money you want to play with, go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely. If you keep it simple, itтАЩs easier to track and respond. But for the rest of us, the smart investment is  those index funds. They cost less than stocks or other funds. They remove most of the emotion from your decision making, which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions. ThatтАЩs your best bet in 2017.
49	For Megyn Kelly, the shift from Fox News to NBC  тАФ   where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program  тАФ   will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. But her move, announced Tuesday, has broader implications for the television news industry, raising new questions about the future of Fox News, where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with   ideology, and of NBC News, which has been a longtime b├кte noire for conservative press critics. And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. The Murdoch family, which controls Fox NewsтАЩs parent company, 21st Century Fox, had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the networkтАЩs future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor  тАФ   for instance, by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president. But now Fox News, long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate, is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no   anchor with Ms. KellyтАЩs history of challenging Mr. Trump. Her show, тАЬThe Kelly File,тАЭ was sandwiched between the   program of Bill OтАЩReilly  тАФ   she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings  тАФ   and that of Mr. TrumpтАЩs major booster, Sean Hannity. Her departure, coming after that of Greta Van Susteren, also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summerтАШs sexual harassment scandal involving its   and former chairman, Roger Ailes, in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (Fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for Ms. Kelly.) For NBC, the addition of Ms. Kelly, 46, may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. In bringing Ms. Kelly to NBC, Andrew Lack, the chairman of the news division, is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative Americans who helped elect Mr. Trump, and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. Ms. KellyтАЩs closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere, in which she was often at the center of Mr. TrumpтАЩs intense,   campaign, and in the media world, where she became a key figure in the events that led to Mr. AilesтАЩs ouster. Ms. Kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that Mr. Ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (Mr. Ailes has denied all the accusations.) Despite having made a generous offer to Ms. Kelly, Rupert Murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, whose   negotiation tactics are legendary, offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. тАЬWe thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News,тАЭ the statement read. тАЬWe hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. тАЭ Though the loss of Ms. Kelly is a blow to Fox News, the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years, and helped it to avoid the   its rivals experienced in the weeks after Election Day, as The Associated Press reported. And now the nation has a new Republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of FoxтАЩs viewers. Company executives said the Murdochs knew Ms. Kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time, and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. Ms. Kelly had spoken with top executives at ABC News, CNN and in the syndication industry, as well as NBC News, but NBC remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. One person briefed on Ms. KellyтАЩs deliberations said that Mr. Lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking, instead of flatly offering possibilities. He then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. A daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband, Douglas Brunt, a novelist. People briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, declined to disclose what Ms. KellyтАЩs new annual salary would be at NBC. Fox News rivals who sought to hire Ms. Kelly away, including NBC News, had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from Fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. But even a modest raise for Ms. Kelly would place her among televisionтАЩs   journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. Her high price tag was worth it for Mr. Lack, who took over leadership of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015, 14 years after he had ended an   tenure running the divisions. Executives at NBC Universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor Brian Williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in Iraq, and as MSNBC floundered in the ratings. Among his moves since returning has been to direct MSNBC back toward more traditional, hard news coverage during its daytime hours  тАФ   like its cable news rivals, it hit record ratings highs last year  тАФ   and away from its yearslong market position as a   answer to Fox News, which at times colored the reputation of its sister, NBC News. Ms. Kelly will not be reporting for MSNBC, which still has     hosts like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence OтАЩDonnell. In a brief interview, Mr. Lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of Ms. KellyтАЩs daytime show, which will run Monday through Friday at a time to be determined, as well as the one she will anchor on Sunday nights. That show will be in the vein of CBSтАЩs тАЬ60 Minutes,тАЭ where Mr. Lack worked early in his career. тАЬThe thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows,тАЭ he said. тАЬYou donтАЩt get that opportunity that often any more, and you donтАЩt get the opportunity to do that with a talent like Megyn. тАЭ Yet the move has its risks for all involved, especially the daytime program. Daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. People involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show, nor much like the     special Ms. Kelly hosted last May on the Fox broadcast network, which drew some harsh criticism (some of which Ms. Kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with Mr. Trump). In an interview with Charlie Rose on тАЬCBS Sunday MorningтАЭ last year, Ms. Kelly described the television show of her fantasies. тАЬHow about if we merge a little Charlie Rose, a little Oprah, and a little me all together,тАЩтАЩ she said. тАЬAnd we serve that up as an hour? WouldnтАЩt you watch that?тАЭ Ms. Kelly kept a relatively low profile on Tuesday, addressing her own news at the end of that nightтАЩs edition of тАЬThe Kelly File. тАЭ тАЬThis was a tough decision for me,тАЭ Ms. Kelly said, thanking the Murdochs and attributing the move in part to her desire for more time with her children. Her last show on Fox is on Friday.
50	Megyn KellyтАЩs new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career, Ms. Kelly, the No.   personality in cable television news, is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader, but more fickle, viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  тАФ   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly, 46, will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: тАЬ60 MinutesтАЭ on CBS. Still, Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this yearтАЩs presidential campaign, when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years, acquiring one of televisionтАЩs biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events, like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  тАФ   from Fox, NBC and other rival channels  тАФ   suggest that Ms. KellyтАЩs performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor, she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  тАФ   her first major foray outside cable news  тАФ   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  тАФ   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump, the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  тАФ   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50, the demographic most important to broadcasters, Ms. KellyтАЩs special performed about as well as ABCтАЩs тАЬBeyond the Tank,тАЭ a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley, Meredith Vieira, Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past, and each one failed. In Ms. PauleyтАЩs case, NBC invested millions of dollars, but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. KellyтАЩs show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show, although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like тАЬDays of Our Lives,тАЭ тАЬThe Ellen DeGeneres ShowтАЭ and тАЬSteve Harvey. тАЭ The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than FoxтАЩs   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to тАЬ60 Minutes,тАЭ the   among newsmagazines, is likewise no easy task. тАЬRock Center,тАЭ which Brian Williams hosted, lasted two seasons. NBCтАЩs most recent newsmagazine, тАЬOn Assignment,тАЭ ran    against тАЬ60 MinutesтАЭ over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers, compared with more than nine million for тАЬ60 Minutes,тАЭ which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season, тАЬ60 MinutesтАЭ is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. KellyтАЩs show during the National Football League season, when NBCтАЩs popular тАЬSunday Night FootballтАЭ package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack, NBC NewsтАЩs chairman, has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a тАЬ60 MinutesтАЭ competitor on CBS in the 1980s, Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines, including the networkтАЩs popular тАЬDateline,тАЭ dominated   lineups. Fox, meanwhile, must now set a course without one of its biggest names, as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman, Roger Ailes. Ms. KellyтАЩs exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup, with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom, where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  тАФ   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren, another veteran anchor, announced her departure in September, network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end, Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  тАФ   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith, a host of FoxтАЩs noon show, тАЬOutnumberedтАЭ Trish Regan, a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream, who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum, a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a host of тАЬThe FiveтАЭ who is friendly with Mr. TrumpтАЩs circle, and Tucker Carlson, who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox NewsтАЩs 7 p. m. slot, have also been suggested. Sean Hannity, whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day, could be moved up an hour, but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN, even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN, while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin, has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54, the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016, CNN finished within 58, 000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  тАФ   cutting FoxтАЩs lead in half. Since the election, Fox has regained a sizable lead, but now, without spending a penny, CNN will now have an opportunity to take another run at FoxтАЩs   advantage.
51	QINGYUAN, China  тАФ   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2, 800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts, the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day, kicking, dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. тАЬSoccer will be my career after I grow up,тАЭ Wang Kai, a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years, said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. тАЬI want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo,тАЭ he said, referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China, where the countryтАЩs No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China, whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks, the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year, the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year, but he declined, his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte, the manager of EnglandтАЩs fabled Chelsea team, denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a тАЬdanger for all teams in the world. тАЭ The drive to match ChinaтАЩs economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. XiтАЩs ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. тАЬMy biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the worldтАЩs best,тАЭ he announced in 2015. In the last two years, the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted menтАЩs World Cup and returning the womenтАЩs team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players, Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs, hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. тАЬCurrent spending has created massive expectations,тАЭ said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. тАЬSpending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. тАЭ But if soccer distills Mr. XiтАЩs national ambitions, it also illustrates how his plans could falter, as they have in other arenas, in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement, especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents, worried about their children taking precious time away from academics, as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer, it turns out, are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick, flashy success is putting   goals at risk. PeopleтАЩs Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, warned last month of a тАЬbubbleтАЭ of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations, while some clubs, officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players, the newspaper said. тАЬOne of the biggest problems is тАЭ said Cameron Wilson, a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football, a website that follows the sport in China. тАЬThere are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces, itтАЩs like people doing their own thing. тАЭ ChinaтАЩs passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national menтАЩs team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings, just ahead of the Faroe Islands, a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50, 000 inhabitants, and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The womenтАЩs team  тАФ   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  тАФ   has stumbled. It was   for the WomenтАЩs World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. тАЬThe national team is a joke,тАЭ said Xu Yun, 16, who had come to WorkersтАЩ Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. тАЬI think it will need decades to get it right. ItтАЩs not just a question of spending money, itтАЩs attitude. тАЭ For years, the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption, brazen even by ChinaтАЩs   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009, the worst cheating has been cleaned up. тАЬIt still exists,тАЭ Mr. Wilson said. тАЬJust not so blatantly. тАЭ For Xi, soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012, he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September, he revisited his old school in Beijing, where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game, according to memoirs of his former teacher. тАЬLook how healthy I am,тАЭ Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. тАЬI laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. тАЭ Private investors have piled into professional soccer, encouraged by XiтАЩs backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year, the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players, outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million, according to FIFA TMS, a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. XiтАЩs focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50, 000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025, a leap from 5, 000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70, 000 by the end of 2020, from under 11, 000. By then, the plan says, 50 million Chinese, including 30 million students, will regularly play soccer. тАЬNow principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer,тАЭ said Dai Wei, the athletic director at r. XiтАЩs old school, the Bayi School. тАЬThat was unthinkable before. тАЭ Yet there is deep cultural resistance, even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports, Mr. Dai said, because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age, the country has not done as well at fostering group sports, where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school, the worldтАЩs biggest soccer boarding school, says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. тАЬAs more soccer schools are built, thereтАЩll be more and more kids playing, and the stars will multiply, too,тАЭ said Liu Jiangnan, the principal of the school, which opened in 2012. тАЬIтАЩd guess that in seven or eight years, half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. тАЭ Drawn by such hopes, parents pay up to about $8, 700 a year to send children here, where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships, and children from poorer families get discounts, school officials said. But even here, the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts, and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics, said Sergio Zarco Diaz, a Spanish coach. тАЬThe kids are getting better, year by year,тАЭ he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools, facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields, have devised their own drills, like soccer gymnastics, in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up, down and around. It may impress visiting officials, but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game, said Zhang Lu, a widely respected soccer commentator. тАЬChinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success,тАЭ Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing, recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. тАЬThe problem is that everyoneтАЩs thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results, competition, training, creating stars. тАЭ Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist,   approach, he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon, the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields, shouting and squealing with delight. тАЬThis morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog,тАЭ said the principal, Lin Yanling. тАЬBut at midday I notified the kids that it was back on, and they all went crazy with relief. тАЭ
52	In the technology industry, the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years, the biggest players in tech  тАФ   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  тАФ   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow, blind and dumb, to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then, in the last half decade, something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago, I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business, one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, GoogleтАЩs parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year, their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible, but also maybe even probable. In 2017, much the same story remains, but there is a new wrinkle: The worldтАЩs governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States, Europe, Asia and South America, the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers, and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region, including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. TrumpтАЩs broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year. LetтАЩs start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the worldтАЩs 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  тАФ   mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  тАФ   on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance. The Five arenтАЩt exactly immune to business cycles. AppleтАЩs sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, AlphabetтАЩs stock price hit a plateau. The Five also arenтАЩt entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   todayтАЩs most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under peopleтАЩs skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way youтАЩre supposed to in America  тАФ   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins werenтАЩt considered that bad. They werenтАЩt causing environmental disasters. They werenтАЩt selling cigarettes. They werenтАЩt bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the FiveтАЩs growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadnтАЩt I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing peopleтАЩs unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terroristтАЩs iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. BezosтАЩs main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industryтАЩs antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  тАФ   entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others. тАЬDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,тАЭ said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. GenachowskiтАЩs term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring тАЬnetwork neutrality,тАЭ which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. тАЬThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things  тАФ   battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,тАЭ he said. ThatтАЩs where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger  тАФ   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  тАФ   when deciding how to police them. But thereтАЩs a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among todayтАЩs  . The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining,   assistants,   cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful.
53	BEIJING  тАФ   A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the cityтАЩs mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday, injuring them before fleeing and killing himself, the official news media reported. Privately owned guns are rare in China, because of a virtual ban on civilian use, and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua, an industrial city in Sichuan Province, rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news. Panzhihua was built as part of MaoтАЩs plans to relocate factories deep inland, where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by ChinaтАЩs president, Xi Jinping, to remake officialdom into a clean, impeccably disciplined bureaucracy. Details were sparse, and there were no clues to the gunmanтАЩs motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau, Chen Zhongshu, bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there. тАЬThe gunman stormed into the meeting, fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled,тАЭ said an online report by Sichuan Daily, an official provincial newspaper, citing the Panzhihua government press office. The suspect in the shooting, Mr. Chen, was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life, the report said without giving details. The mayor, Li Jianqin, and party secretary, Zhang Yan, were wounded and sent to the hospital, but their injuries were not considered   the report said. Mr. Zhang, the party secretary, has worked in Panzhihua since 2006, and the mayor, Mr. Li, has worked there since last year, according to Chinese news reports. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously, but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing. Photographs on Chinese news websites showed armored vehicles and paramilitary troops massed outside the exhibition center in the aftermath of the violence.
54	A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a   Police Department data shows, a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the cityтАЩs roughest neighborhoods. The internal police data, obtained by The New York Times, paints a detailed portrait of the motives, locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years.   shootings fell to 412 in 2016, from 560 the year before, according to the data, which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year.   killings dropped to 79 in 2016, from 129 in 2015. Those   helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by yearтАЩs end, police officials said, down from 1, 138 in 2015. Murders also fell, to 335 from 352 the year before. The New York City police commissioner, James P. OтАЩNeill, has noted the departmentтАЩs efforts to push shootings below 1, 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s, when the police began keeping similar records. Mr. OтАЩNeill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Scores of gang takedowns this year, resulting in about 900 arrests, took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in   crimes, police officials said. тАЬPrecision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence, which in a significant amount of cases are gangs,тАЭ said Stephen P. Davis, the departmentтАЩs chief spokesman. тАЬBy going after the gang members, arresting them, we recognize the resultant reduction in violence. тАЭ Violent crime has been more persistent  in some communities, especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department, in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy   enforcement and aggressive tactics like    has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime, said David M. Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. тАЬNew York City, in many ways, convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe,тАЭ he said. тАЬAnd now itтАЩs showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that, you should not do it, and there are much, much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety. тАЭ The reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities, most notably Chicago, which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides. The New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the departmentтАЩs Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime, as well as the   tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed. Shootings and murders dropped across almost every category of motive last year. Murders in which drugs were the primary motive, for example, dropped to 29 in 2016, from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly, to 57 last year from 49 in 2015. Criminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders, but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent, because it can escalate inside homes, without the police being notified. Mr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results, but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York. Fewer people were murdered with guns in 2016, but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73, from 50 the year before. Murders and shootings on the street, in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12, from three the year before, and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly, murders indoors ticked up by 19, while outdoor murders fell by 49. About a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and more than half happened between 6 p. m. and 2 a. m. The biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a тАЬdispute. тАЭ Of those, the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged, followed by disputes over a man or woman, over money, and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act, two by gambling and two by road rage. Just under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest, and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads. Forty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest, and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance, a category that would include cases in which the person suspected of being the killer was murdered before an arrest was made.
55	Our new president is a    billionaire Ivy League graduate, a real estate tycoon, a TV star and a son of inherited wealth. But he is no longer, by his own calculations, a member of the тАЬelite. тАЭ Nor are the men (and the few women) now joining his inner circle  тАФ     and corporate executives, Harvard and Yale alumni, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers. The true elite apparently sits elsewhere, among those who, in Sarah PalinтАЩs notable 2008 formulation, think тАЬthat theyтАЩre  тАФ   I guess  тАФ   better than anyone else. тАЭ As an adjective, the word тАЬeliteтАЭ still conveys something positive, even aspirational: elite athlete, elite model, elite travel services. But as a noun, embodied by actual living people, it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. тАЬElites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans,тАЭ complains TrumpтАЩs adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard, Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation, elites are a destructive, condescending collective, plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks, the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history,   sentiment was a matter of up versus down, not left versus right. But about half a century ago, the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture, where the тАЬeliteтАЭ could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad, instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to тАЬtake his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. тАЭ Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. тАЬI was on the right side of that issue, as you know, with the people,тАЭ he boasted after Brexit, adding that тАЬHillary, as always, stood with the elites. тАЭ His complaints against тАЬpolitical correctnessтАЭ conjure a world of absurdist campus politics, where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. тАЬMedia elitesтАЭ come in for special attack, cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies, labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      тАЬpeopleтАЭ versus the    тАЬelites. тАЭ His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview, one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question, now, is whether itтАЩs possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  тАФ   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers, whose Declaration of Independence lamented the тАЬlong train of abuses and usurpationsтАЭ inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on, United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the FoundersтАЩ aristocratic pretensions. Northern тАЬfree laborтАЭ went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism, with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons, bankers,   experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders, champions of the тАЬpeopleтАЭ against the тАЬpowers. тАЭ But by the middle of the 20th century, alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy, a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book тАЬThe Age of Reform,тАЭ Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later, his тАЬ  in American LifeтАЭ documented a dangerous suspicion of тАЬthe critical mindтАЭ that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective, the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life, with Dwight EisenhowerтАЩs тАЬphilistinismтАЭ winning over Adlai StevensonтАЩs тАЬintellect. тАЭ Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an тАЬelite. тАЭ That word conveyed something different  тАФ   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills, in his 1956 assessment of AmericaтАЩs тАЬpower elite. тАЭ тАЬThey rule the big corporations,тАЭ Mills wrote. тАЬThey run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. тАЭ In MillsтАЩs view, these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large,    institutions. As individuals, they might be Republicans or Democrats, and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics, where a more partisan, targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book, тАЬGod and Man at Yale,тАЭ drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term тАЬeliteтАЭ to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech, тАЬA Time for Choosing,тАЭ delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. тАЬThis is the issue of this election,тАЭ he said: тАЬwhether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. тАЭ Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout, but ReaganтАЩs vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming тАЬculture wars,тАЭ pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s, with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill OтАЩReilly, bashing the тАЬliberal eliteтАЭ had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way, some тАЬliberal elitesтАЭ have accepted at least part of their detractorsтАЩ critique, particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill ClintonтАЩs presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published тАЬThe Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,тАЭ which mourned that тАЬ   liberalsтАЭ had turned into тАЬpetulant,   intolerantтАЭ scolds, thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then, the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers, including MSNBCтАЩs Chris Hayes, whose 2012 тАЬTwilight of the ElitesтАЭ called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal тАЬmeritocracyтАЭ  тАФ   a system, he argued, that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins, we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy, preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  тАФ   and, oddly, to have helped elect a wealthy, preening incoming president. Meanwhile, both liberal and conservative тАЬelitesтАЭ are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency, such тАЬelitesтАЭ may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise, the man in the White House will do it for them.
56	тАЬWill you marry me?тАЭ Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year, and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase  тАФ   where to do it, when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be  тАФ   remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make. Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year, or whose weddings The Times learned about, got engaged in unusual spots  тАФ   from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the cityтАЩs streets  тАФ   and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama. And, of course, at least several can now be found on YouTube. Here are 10 of our most engaging stories of the year. Mr. Litman, who first began dating Ms. Michelis in the eighth grade at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, proposed in November 2015 in Montauk, N. Y. the entire scene captured by a drone hovering above on an unusually warm   day at the beach. With waves rushing the shore and the Montauk Point Lighthouse in the distance, Ms. Michelis can be seen from a windblown aerial view playfully running beneath the drone before turning back to Mr. Litman. As she runs closer, he drops to his knee, engagement ring in hand. Momentarily shocked at the sight, she drops her purse as he asks her to marry him, and the two then fall into each otherтАЩs arms. тАЬThe first thing that came to my mind was, I canтАЩt wait to show it to our kids,тАЭ Ms. Michelis said. They were married Oct. 8. The couple first met in fall 2011 while working on the digital team for Mr. ObamaтАЩs   campaign. After the presidentтАЩs victory, Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for Mr. Obama. In 2015, Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during the Organizing for Action Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June, Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president, and told him that he was bent on proposing (which he would do three months later). тАЬYou got a rock picked out and all that?тАЭ he recalled Mr. Obama asking. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice. Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and who understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. WilsonтАЩs best friend, the president responded, тАЬI think thatтАЩs the right strategy, but youтАЩve got to swear her to secrecy. тАЭ The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. WilsonтАЩs best friend, he pulled her aside. тАЬI told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States,тАЭ he said. Mission accomplished. Mr. Fallsgraff and Ms. Wilson were married July 3. The couple, who met in June 2015 through a dating app called the League, went to Paris six months later for a New YearтАЩs celebration. While at a restaurant there, Mr. Purcell ordered a bottle of Champagne for what he thought was 110 euros, the equivalent of about $119. But when the bill arrived after dinner, he realized he had mistakenly ordered a bottle of vintage Champagne  тАФ   the 2003 Dom P├йrignon Ros├й  тАФ   at a cost of 1, 100 euros, a total at the time of roughly $1, 195. In May, Mr. Purcell invited Ms. Bui to the rooftop of his apartment building in San Francisco to enjoy the unobstructed   view that included the Golden Gate Bridge. As they took in the view, Mr. Purcell surprised Ms. Bui by breaking out an expensive bottle of the same vintage Champagne he had mistakenly bought in Paris. It was all a part of a special occasion, he told her, and then he surprised her again, this time with an engagement ring. They were married Nov. 26. The couple, who met in 2007 while they were working for the New York City Department of City Planning, became engaged in May 2014, when Mr. Meagher proposed while they were on a tour of the construction site of the 86th Street station, part of the Second Avenue subway. The tour, conducted below street level, included residents who live near the new subway line as well as officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. тАЬWeтАЩre both passionate about cities and infrastructure,тАЭ Mr. Meagher said. And about each other, as the group learned when Mr. Meagher, wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest, got down on one knee and asked Ms. Grossman, who was wearing the same gear, to marry him. Gasps, then applause, broke out among the tour group, as well as from the brideтАЩs parents, who had also shown up for the occasion. They were married Jan. 9. The couple met in August 2014 during a performance of the Broadway musical тАЬA GentlemanтАЩs Guide to Love and Murder. тАЭ Mr. Fogelman, who was there alone, tried to move to an empty seat next to Ms. Phillips to get a better view of the stage. тАЬNot in the middle of a song,тАЭ said Ms. Phillips, who was there with a friend. Mr. Fogelman waited until after the song to switch seats, and at intermission, he apologized profusely to her for his poor theater etiquette. She forgave him, he sat down next to her, and they began talking. They were soon dating, and in August 2015, while sitting in those same seats, Mr. Fogelman turned to Ms. Phillips at intermission and proposed. тАЬIt turned out to be a wonderful   at the theater,тАЭ Ms. Phillips said, тАЬone that I will never forget. тАЭ They were married Sept. 4. Mr. Whelden, a plumber in Boston who sings with two professional   touring a cappella groups (Five OтАЩClock Shadow and Overboard) proposed during his performance at a New YearтАЩs Eve concert in Rockport, Mass. The crowd roared when he sang тАЬFall in Love,тАЭ a song he wrote for his future bride that included the words тАЬwill you marry me. тАЭ тАЬIt was the most amazing, romantic proposal I couldтАЩve ever imagined,тАЭ Ms. Delaney said. They were married May 7. The couple, who were both living in Park Slope, Brooklyn, met through OkCupid in early 2011. They immediately became a couple. In July 2015, they moved into a   together in Bay Ridge. On their first day in the new place, Ms. Roth put in motion her proposal while Ms. Marini was at work. She was hiding when Ms. Marini returned, and watched her follow a path of lighted candles to a makeshift bed where Chinese food boxes had been placed across the floor, leading to a smaller box. (тАЬMelina had always idealized the movie trope of people moving into a new apartment thatтАЩs not yet furnished, and having to eat Chinese food on the floor, тАЭ Ms. Roth explained.) When Ms. Marini opened the smaller box, which contained an engagement ring, she started sobbing. Along with the ring was a note that said: тАЬWill you marry me? Check yes or no. тАЭ Ms. Marini checked тАЬyes,тАЭ and she and Ms. Roth, who came out of hiding, cried in each otherтАЩs arms. тАЬIтАЩm not the type of person who wants to see тАШWill you marry me?тАЩ splashed across a Jumbotron,тАЭ Ms. Marini said. тАЬThis was much more intimate to me, and much more meaningful. тАЭ They were married Aug. 6. The couple met on March 11, 2005, while shooting pool in what Ms. Powell described as a dim, smoky bar on Avenue B in Manhattan. They shared several beers, then a single kiss outside the bar. Mr. Albertson, 23 at the time, was beyond taken with her, but Ms. Powell, then 20, was not quite ready for a serious relationship. They settled on becoming friends. Ms. Powell eventually married another man, and fell out of touch with Mr. Albertson. By May 2014, however, Ms. Powell was divorced and dating Mr. Albertson, often telling him that the word тАЬmarriageтАЭ now frightened her. On March 11, 2015, 10 years to the day they met, they were back on Avenue B and heading into that same dim, smoky bar when Ms. Powell looked down and saw a huge chalk mark indicating the spot where she had first kissed him. She turned to find him down on one knee, holding her engagement ring. тАЬI was freaking out,тАЭ she said. тАЬI just started crying and hugging him. тАЭ He proposed but managed to avoid scaring her by leaving out the word тАЬmarriage. тАЭ тАЬI was wondering,тАЭ he said, тАЬif you wanted to hang out with me forever. тАЭ They were married March 11. Mr. Turke, who proposed in February, chose to give his future bride a full day of   bliss, rather than a single moment of happiness. An hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a. m. he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen, where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her, including one that read, тАЬToday is the day that we get engaged,тАЭ and another that read, тАЬEnjoy the moments ahead of you, have fun and say тАШyes. тАЩтАЭ What ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took Ms. Helmling to the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan, where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table. A waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa, where they each enjoyed Champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures. Later in the day, Ms. Helmling was chauffeured over the George Washington Bridge to a small park in New Jersey overlooking the Hudson River  тАФ   the spot where Mr. Turke had first asked her out in September 2013. тАЬWhen she arrived, we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day,тАЭ said Mr. Turke, who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in it, arranged in chronological order as a way of telling their story. Then he proposed, and Ms. Helmling cried some more. They were married Nov. 13. The couple met online in 2008. At the time, Mr. Stucky was living in Somerville, Mass. and going through a divorce. They were soon dating, but their relationship began to sputter. In the space of three years, each of them proposed to the other, and each was soundly rejected. In June 2014, Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The episode left her paralyzed for nearly six hours  тАФ   and longing again for Mr. Stucky, whom she was no longer seeing. тАЬI canтАЩt believe I havenтАЩt been telling you every day that I love you,тАЭ she called to tell him the moment she got back on her feet. Mr. Stucky was feeling much the same way, as he too had had a   experience, he said, a nightmare in which he was on his knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling him he had only 24 hours to live. Completely shaken, he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him, and quickly realized that Ms. Mathiowetz was at the top of that list. Those shared experiences brought them back together, and in January 2015, Mr. Stucky proposed to Ms. Mathiowetz, for a second time, during a weekend trip at a    in Portsmouth, N. H. This time, she accepted. They were married June 11.
57	Alicia Rivera, a    single mother with four children and big dreams, must budget her money and her time wisely. тАЬI got my kids,тАЭ Ms. Rivera said. тАЬI donтАЩt want to waste my time. тАЭ Ms. Rivera and her children  тАФ   Joaquin, 17 Nelson, 16 Alyssa, 11 and Rafael, 2  тАФ   live in a   apartment in the Bronx, near the southern tip of the Bronx River Parkway. The past few years have sometimes been overwhelming for her as she tries to raise her children by herself, get an education and lay the foundation for a professional career. When she was seven months pregnant with Rafael, Ms. Rivera injured her back while working as a home health aide. Soon after he was born, she switched to another job, helping   people navigate complicated real estate and tax forms and other paperwork. Ms. Rivera makes about $100 every week. She also receives $216 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $506 a month in food stamps. With a monthly rent of $308, she needs to keep a frugal budget. But Ms. Rivera has a plan. She is on track to receive an associate degree from Plaza College in April. Her goal is to then earn a bachelorтАЩs degree and a masterтАЩs degree, both in business, from Metropolitan College of New York. She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx. Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes. But she loved dancing in front of the familyтАЩs television as they watched the   variety show тАЬS├бbado Gigante. тАЭ тАЬAnd you see these kids dancing, and you see me dancing in the living room, too,тАЭ Ms. Rivera said. тАЬI used to wear my momтАЩs makeup, her heels. тАЭ Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children, especially Joaquin, who leads a dance team at his school, the Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy, near Fordham University in the Bronx. She watched him at a dance rehearsal at the school, and she said the studentsтАЩ moves reminded her of the тАЬStep UpтАЭ movie series. тАЬMade me laugh, made me have a good time,тАЭ she said. тАЬI felt like joining them,тАЭ she said, beaming. At times, Ms. Rivera has struggled to balance her obligations at home, school and work. As she devoted more time to her studies, her son Nelson, who attends the same academy as Joaquin, started having trouble at school. A counselor there contacted her, saying that Nelson did not want to go to class. The counselor referred her to the Family Assistance Program, which soon referred them to the ChildrenтАЩs Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At ChildrenтАЩs Aid, Ms. Rivera said, she learned how to improve her parenting. She said she used to get frustrated and yell at Nelson when he struggled to get up and get ready in the morning. A counselor told her that yelling at him was not going to solve the problem. Therapy sessions with the family also made it clear that her sons needed their own rooms. Ms. Rivera said she started to notice positive changes at home after several months of therapy. Her older sons now have their own rooms. Alyssa agreed to share a room with her mother and Rafael. Her elder sons are more focused now. Nelson comes to her with problems, not letting them linger, and they work them out together. Joaquin is starting to research colleges. The ChildrenтАЩs Aid Society also provided Ms. Rivera $413 in Neediest funds to replace her sonsтАЩ broken beds with new ones. Nelson and a friend put them together, she said. While still attending school, Nelson is taking some online courses, which cost $49 a month. Ms. Rivera wants to withdraw Nelson to take online classes full time so that she can monitor his schoolwork more carefully. In addition to opening a dance school, Ms. Rivera wants to start a business similar to her present workplace. While the family has learned to resolve problems, Ms. Rivera refuses to lower her expectations. She bristles when she hears her children or their friends say they cannot do something. тАЬDonтАЩt say, тАШI canтАЩt,тАЩтАЭ she said. тАЬJoaquin never says, тАШI canтАЩt,тАЩ because he hears me. тАЭ That is one way she lays the foundation for her childrenтАЩs future. Ms. Rivera said Alyssa was struggling one day with homework. So she took time out of her own schoolwork, encouraged her daughter and patiently walked her through the steps of writing a   essay. тАЬIt took her three hours, and when she was done, I said, тАШYou see? You could do it. тАЩтАЭ
58	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. ObamaтАЩs signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. тАЬThe American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,тАЭ Mr. Pence said, тАЬand we are determined to give them that. тАЭ He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. TrumpтАЩs campaign slogan, said repealing the law would тАЬmake America sick again. тАЭ Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without DemocratsтАЩ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with AmericaтАЩs health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to тАЬbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,тАЭ and added, тАЬDonтАЩt let the Schumer clowns out of this web. тАЭ Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would тАЬfall of its own weight. тАЭ Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. TrumpтАЩs top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. тАЬWe have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,тАЭ Mr. Collins said. тАЬAnd that was a key piece of Donald TrumpтАЩs campaign. тАЭ But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. тАЬThere will naturally be a reasonable transition period,тАЭ said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. тАЬYou canтАЩt adopt new reforms all at once. тАЭ Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into тАЬthe ditch we find ourselves in now. тАЭ тАЬWhen your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,тАЭ Mr. Cornyn said. тАЬAnd sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. тАЭ To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, тАЬthe first thing I donтАЩt do is dismantle the car. тАЭ тАЬThat doesnтАЩt help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,тАЭ she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would тАЬregret that they came out so fast out of the box. тАЭ He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. тАЬIf you are repealing, show us what youтАЩll replace it with first,тАЭ Mr. Schumer said. тАЬThen weтАЩll look at what you have and see what we can do. тАЭ Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, тАЬItтАЩs his and their responsibility, plain and simple  тАФ   name calling isnтАЩt going to get anything done. тАЭ He added, тАЬThey really need to calm things down a little. тАЭ Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. тАЬThe point is, in 2017, we donтАЩt want people to be caught with nothing,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe want to make sure that thereтАЩs an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. тАЭ Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the RepublicansтАЩ rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a тАЬpep rallyтАЭ for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. ObamaтАЩs last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the presidentтАЩs words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against тАЬrescuingтАЭ Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, тАЬHe acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. тАЭ
59	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane, but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nationтАЩs most important laws. тАЬReconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget,тАЭ the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending, especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits, it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  тАФ   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate, a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills, a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint, a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue, deficit, debt and spending levels in areas like defense, energy, education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals, Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  тАФ   reconciled with  тАФ   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980, Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the тАЬReagan revolution. тАЭ It squeezed savings out of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the school lunch program, farm subsidies, student loans, welfare and jobless benefits, among many other programs. In 1996, Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy, eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nationтАЩs poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill, pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the ChildrenтАЩs Health Insurance Program, primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997, Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions, Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year, with support from   Donald J. Trump, who calls the law тАЬan absolute disaster. тАЭ Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House, leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate, by contrast, one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leadersтАЩ plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours, so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule, named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending, taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule, but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could, for example, eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act, which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate, for example, that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a personтАЩs   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26, and they cannot charge women higher rates than men, as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular, but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies, supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference, altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill.
60	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Majorities in Congress often overreach, but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldnтАЩt stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. тАЬMr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,тАЭ Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. тАЬThat is not a good way to start. тАЭ Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldnтАЩt be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  тАЩs Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. TrumpтАЩs cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. TrumpтАЩs megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated тАЬearmarksтАЭ as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. TrumpтАЩs election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  тАФ   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  тАФ   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. тАЬI think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,тАЭ said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. тАЬIt protects you from political attacks. тАЭ The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. тАЬI just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,тАЭ Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now.
61	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Ivanka Trump, who is weighing a prominent role in her fatherтАЩs administration, is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington, two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The house was previously owned by a   financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader. Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, a close adviser to   Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration, have chosen a      house just around the corner from President ObamaтАЩs new home. The newly renovated house, with its sleekly modern d├йcor, sold for $5. 5 million in December, the people said, insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private. The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife, Irina, according to property records filed with the District of Columbia. Neither responded to emailed requests for comment. Ms. TrumpтАЩs relocation plans, first reported by Washingtonian magazine, are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. TrumpтАЩs administration. Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition. People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move, as did William F. X. Moody, a   at Washington Fine Properties, who first disclosed the deal. But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live  тАФ     of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit  тАФ   residents have been buzzing about their    neighbors. тАЬEverybodyтАЩs atwitter about it,тАЭ said Tony Podesta, chairman of the Podesta Group, a top Washington lobbying firm. тАЬIтАЩve been getting lots of emails saying, тАШHere we go again,тАЩ тАЭ Mr. Podesta said, alluding to the burst of local mayhem that attended the decision by Mr. Obama and his family to rent a   home in the neighborhood after they leave the White House. тАЬIt will be great to have them as neighbors,тАЭ Mr. Podesta said of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who have three children. The white house on Tracy Place where Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner plan to live with their children is just around the corner from the ObamasтАЩ luxurious   home on Belmont Road, which has been undergoing extensive renovations directed by the Secret Service to fortify it for their arrival. A security checkpoint is expected to be built at the intersection of Tracy and Belmont before Mr. Obama moves in, residents said. There was no sign of Ms. Trump or her husband at the house on Wednesday afternoon. But the property was a flurry of activity, as workers and painters filed in and out past television reporters staked out on the sidewalk and   speculated about their new neighbors. John Damgard, who has owned a house on the block since 1971, said his new neighbors could expect to be welcomed тАЬwith open arms,тАЭ even by the neighborhoodтАЩs Democrats. тАЬItтАЩs quiet, itтАЩs private, and theyтАЩll be graciously received,тАЭ Mr. Damgard said. The house was home for several decades to Renee Zlotnick Kraft, a Washington fur heiress and socialite, who frequently opened its doors for events and even occasionally rolled out a pink carpet to welcome the cityтАЩs dinner party set. According to the website of his investment firm, Rapoport Capital, Mr. Rapoport was born in Riga, Latvia, and has lived in the United States, France and Russia. Vladimir Ashurkov, a top aide to Aleksei A. Navalny, a leading Russian opposition leader and critic of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, described Mr. Rapoport as a successful financier in Moscow and an investor in Soho Rooms, one of the cityтАЩs poshest nightclubs. He has also been a supporter of Mr. Navalny since 2010. He recently relocated from Washington to Kiev, Ukraine, where he manages a private equity fund, Mr. Ashurkov said. It was not clear whether Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner bought the house from the Rapoports or would be renting it from a new owner. But after scouting locations in other exclusive neighborhoods, including nearby Georgetown, the couple settled on a home less than two miles from the White House.
62	The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insiderтАЩs insider  тАФ   a deal maker. As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agencyтАЩs two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a   seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed, he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agencyтАЩs current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise  Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert MurdochтАЩs News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive. Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commissionтАЩs ethics officer. тАЬAn ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts,тАЭ she noted. Yet Mr. ClaytonтАЩs nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan  Cromwell, where Mr. Clayton is a partner, has been GoldmanтАЩs   law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren E. BuffettтАЩs Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. ClaytonтАЩs wife works as a   adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of GoldmanтАЩs No. 2 executive, Gary D. Cohn, to be the top economic policy adviser to   Donald J. Trump, and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be Treasury secretary. Mr. TrumpтАЩs chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer тАЬwill ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time. тАЭ Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan  Cromwell colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, did in 2009. Mr. Cohen, the dean of Wall Street lawyers, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. тАЬItтАЩs hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep   TrumpтАЩs promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from тАШgetting away with murder,тАЩтАЭ Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said. тАЬI look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from financial institutions the S. E. C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis. тАЭ One issue could be Mr. ClaytonтАЩs representation of Alibaba. The Chinese   giant is under investigation by the S. E. C. over its accounting practices. Mr. Clayton also represented   Capital Management in its $1. 2 billion initial public offering a decade ago, and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New   hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the governmentтАЩs enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which argued that тАЬthe current   regimeтАЭ was тАЬcausing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U. S. regulated companies and the U. S. capital markets. тАЭ Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan  Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the    practitioner could be at the helm of the S. E. C. тАЬHeтАЩs a very smart, pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand,тАЭ said Richard Truesdell, a head of Davis PolkтАЩs global capital markets group, who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. тАЬThereтАЩs been a lot of buzz today, and I have yet to talk to anyone who isnтАЩt pleasantly surprised by the choice. тАЭ The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Mr. TrumpтАЩs economic plan, with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the S. E. C. appointed by President George W. Bush, said Mr. Clayton was a тАЬ  appointment. тАЭ тАЬIt is especially logical with respect to the agencyтАЩs obligation to promote capital formation, a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned,тАЭ said Mr. Pitt in an email. тАЬMr. ClaytonтАЩs background is very impressive  тАФ   both for the depth of his experience, and for the quality of his efforts. тАЭ Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelorтАЩs degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb BushтАЩs primary campaign in 2015, according to public records. Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the     type, a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan  Cromwell. тАЬWhen I think about the position, the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters, so he checks those boxes,тАЭ said Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. тАЬHeтАЩs got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth. тАЭ
63	CHARLESTON, S. C.  тАФ   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life, the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology, no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead, in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial, Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  тАФ   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  тАФ   and left it at that. тАЬOther than the fact that I trust people that I shouldnтАЩt and the fact that IтАЩm probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone whoтАЩs ever existed, thereтАЩs nothing wrong with me psychologically,тАЭ Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, told the jury, which found him guilty last month of the killings at CharlestonтАЩs Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern, Mr. Roof returned to the defense table, exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecutionтАЩs disclosure, in its opening statement, of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. тАЬI would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,тАЭ he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. тАЬI am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. тАЭ Mr. Roof, who was then 21, continued: тАЬI do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. тАЭ As the government laid out its case for a death sentence, the prosecutor who read from the journal, Nathan S. Williams, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. RoofтАЩs deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. тАЬThe defendant didnтАЩt stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people,тАЭ Mr. Williams said, a few moments before he declared, тАЬThe death penalty is justified. тАЭ Later, aided by a slide show, he described each of the victims and their lives, setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret, reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology, but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trialтАЩs sentencing phase, which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15, after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt, the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes, obstruction of religion resulting in death, and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof, now 22, to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence, jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors, like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. RoofтАЩs flat,   monotone during the guilt phase, when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents, his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase, but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. тАЬThe point is that IтАЩm not going to lie to you, not by myself or through somebody else,тАЭ Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom, several women on the right side, which is reserved for victimsтАЩ family members, left their seats, one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and he did not   any of the prosecutionтАЩs witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers, who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses, including at least one survivor of the attack, family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the churchтАЩs slain pastor, and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years, narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together, illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  тАФ   as a young saxophone player in a school band, attending the births of their two daughters, vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as тАЬa voice for the voicelessтАЭ to his work in the South Carolina Legislature, where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles, he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. тАЬHe was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry,тАЭ Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said. тАЬHe was that great catch. тАЭ Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17, 2015, as she and the coupleтАЩs younger daughter, Malana, then 6, listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husbandтАЩs study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall, Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. тАЬI was just like, тАШShh, shh, shh,тАЩ тАЭ Ms. Pinckney said, тАЬand I put my hand over her mouth, and she was holding on to me, and she put her hand on my mouth. тАЭ тАЬMama, is Daddy going to die?тАЭ her daughter asked, Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study, which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, asked why she thought she had been spared. тАЬIt wasnтАЩt my time,тАЭ Ms. Pinckney answered. тАЬI couldnтАЩt see God taking both parents away from two small kids. тАЭ The Rev. Kylon Middleton, an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood, described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and, perhaps, the stateтАЩs first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney, the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49 Cynthia Hurd, 54 Susie Jackson, 87 Ethel Lee Lance, 70 Tywanza Sanders, 26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson, 59. Near the end of the day, Ms. ThompsonтАЩs widower, the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here, told jurors about their   marriage, their anniversary date to a beach, his wifeтАЩs determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears, Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. тАЬShe had her glow,тАЭ he said. тАЬI mean, this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. тАЭ Word of a shooting came hours later, and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. тАЬMy whole world was gone,тАЭ he said. тАЬI literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her, and she was gone. What am I here for? If sheтАЩs gone, what am I here for?тАЭ
64	ISTANBUL  тАФ   Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer. When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month, the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack. And once again, after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New YearтАЩs Day and killed dozens, the   news media pointed a finger at the United States. тАЬAmerica Chief Suspect,тАЭ one headline blared after the attack. On Twitter, a Turkish lawmaker, referring to the name of the nightclub, wrote: тАЬWhoever the triggerman is, Reina attack is an act of CIA. Period. тАЭ Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely, they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow, working with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to secure a   in Syria. One story in the Turkish press, based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey, was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack, which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism, the nightclub attack, even with the gunman still on the run, appears to have only accelerated TurkeyтАЩs shift away from the West, at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection, many critics say, of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of TurkeyтАЩs president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that, instead of unifying to confront terrorism, Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West, symbolized by the United States, is the perennial bogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days  тАФ   by accusing it of supporting TurkeyтАЩs enemies, including the Islamic State Kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup  тАФ   Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once   Donald J. Trump takes office. тАЬOur expectation from the new administration is to end this shame,тАЭ TurkeyтАЩs prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State, but are also an enemy of Turkey. тАЬWe are not holding the new administration responsible for this,тАЭ Mr. Yildirim said. тАЬBecause this is the work of the Obama administration. тАЭ Meanwhile, the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer, but refused to release any other details, although photographs of the man, from surveillance cameras, have been released. Also, a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in IstanbulтАЩs Taksim Square. A senior United States official, who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details, said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan, not Kyrgyzstan, as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing   in Turkey, which seems to accumulate after each crisis here, and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on IstanbulтАЩs streets, with vehicle checkpoints, night raids on houses and   helicopters. тАЬThere is significant fear in ordinary people,тАЭ said Aydin Engin, a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was detained last year as part of the governmentтАЩs crackdown on the news media. тАЬFear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place, being in a crowd, going to a shopping mall, getting on the metro. тАЭ With each passing day, public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity, with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus, nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained,   and placed in solitary confinement  тАФ   for, according to the newspaperтАЩs account, тАЬviolating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State videoтАЭ and a   fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. тАЬIn a way, itтАЩs basically a breakdown of order,тАЭ said Soli Ozel, a Turkish columnist and academic, seeking to explain the tumult in society. тАЬEveryone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it. тАЭ Tugrul Eryilmaz, another longtime Turkish journalist, recalled the countryтАЩs military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed, and said, тАЬI have never been in such a situation like today. тАЭ He brought up the Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu├▒uel, who was known for surreal and absurd themes. тАЬI feel like I am in his movies,тАЭ he said. While Turkey faces a growing terrorism threat, the country is also largely at war with itself, with deep divisions along many lines  тАФ   religion, class, ethnicity  тАФ   that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis. Perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of Mr. Erdogan, about half the country, and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful. тАЬTurkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that, instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped, the   and   blocks in the country are blaming each other,тАЭ said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. тАЬThis is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the countryтАЩs ability to stymie further terror attacks. тАЭ Parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. ErdoganтАЩs government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs, on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen, who now lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning, a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere, often giving speeches daily. Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist, rejected criticism that his government, in pushing an Islamist agenda, had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media, in the aftermath of the nightclub attack, noted that the Turkish governmentтАЩs religious authorities had denounced New YearтАЩs celebrations as  . тАЬAs the president of all 79 million citizens,тАЭ Mr. Erdogan said, тАЬit is my duty to protect everyoneтАЩs rights, law and spaces of freedom. тАЭ Mr. Erdogan, who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call, also told his audience what he believed Turkey, in facing so many terrorist attacks, was really up against: a plot by the West. Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies, he said, тАЬToday Turkey is in a new struggle for independence. тАЭ
65	BEIRUT, Lebanon  тАФ   For millions of Damascus residents,   concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes, wash clothes or take a shower. For nearly two weeks, the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry, caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. тАЬWhen the world gets hard for us, we work something out,тАЭ said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. тАЬWhen you cut off the water, we dig for water. When you cut off the tap, we make a tap. тАЭ Like most of SyriaтАЩs problems, the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced about half the countryтАЩs prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government, armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country, it has not stopped the fighting everywhere, nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies, as appears to be the case with DamascusтАЩs water. Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online, purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the тАЬdeliberate targeting of the water infrastructureтАЭ had caused the  . тАЬBut we are not in a position to say by whom,тАЭ he said. тАЬThe area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it. тАЭ Now, 5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from LebanonтАЩs Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. TurkeyтАЩs foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the cityтАЩs daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house. At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. тАЬMy familyтАЩs dream is to get a warm shower,тАЭ she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. тАЬIt has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. тАЭ She expressed anger that SyriaтАЩs   news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the militaryтАЩs battles with rebels. тАЬWe are fed up with the news of military operations,тАЭ she said. тАЬWe want news about water and water supply schedules. тАЭ Despite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there, the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said. тАЬNothing prepared us for what we saw,тАЭ Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. тАЬThe infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. тАЭ Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400, 000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. тАЬTheyтАЩre beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,тАЭ Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that тАЬAleppoтАЩs reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now. тАЭ
66	Canada, our No. 1 pick for this yearтАЩs 52 Places to Go list, spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (MoreтАЩs the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the provinceтАЩs pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my motherтАЩs terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the islandтАЩs oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to тАЬsmoke of the world,тАЭ was taken into ownership  тАФ   both private and national  тАФ   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  тАФ   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  тАФ   has meant that much of the communityтАЩs historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the KwakiutlтАЩs 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver IslandтАЩs productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of тАЬDo Not Say We Have Nothing. тАЭ Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. KingsmillтАЩs daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the тАЬprisonersтАЭ to fight oppression with noncooperation  тАФ   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake тАЬinvasionтАЭ by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The campsтАЩ explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmersтАЩ unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant тАЬ   тАЭ with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the тАЩ80s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like MoonwatcherтАЩs Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. IтАЩve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  тАЩs board. When the  тАЩs finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  тАФ   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends IтАЩd made there and the dreams weтАЩd shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the islandтАЩs upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color theyтАЩre painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that IтАЩve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel тАЬWalkawayтАЭ and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, YukonтАЩs capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  тАФ   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  тАФ   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed тАЬParis of the NorthтАЭ during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. тАЬIf you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,тАЭ the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the riverтАЩs beach sheets of ice overlapped where theyтАЩd heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasnтАЩt immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, IтАЩd been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that weтАЩre a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. ItтАЩs one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  тАФ   like most  тАФ   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. тАЬJust picking up my mail!тАЭ he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel тАЬFor Today I Am a BoyтАЭ and the poetry collection тАЬHow Festive the Ambulance. тАЭ  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer, a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and OpaтАЩs seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me тАЬSarah Nicole,тАЭ while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but тАЬSarah. тАЭ At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into тАЬ   . тАЭ This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate OmaтАЩs bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before theyтАЩre Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my auntтАЩs ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that OpaтАЩs jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bayтАЩs First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, IтАЩd randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. IтАЩd also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Qu├йb├йcois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the townтАЩs   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters whoтАЩd found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didnтАЩt stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and othersтАЩ looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. IтАЩm still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot. ├Йlise Turcotte, a poet and novelist, is the author of тАЬThe Sound of Living ThingsтАЭ and тАЬGuyana. тАЭ Translated by Allison M.

JтАЩai choisi la vall├йe de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de lтАЩest en Qu├йbec, parce que jтАЩaimais la signification du nom donn├й par les Premi├иres Nations ├а la baie: beaucoup dтАЩoiseaux aquatiques. D├йj├а, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes r├кves, autour de ma t├кte, derri├иre les fen├кtres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger ├а travers les champs de ma├пs. Cette r├йgion me ramenait aussi ├а mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon s├йjour, jтАЩavais point├й mon doigt sur un petit village appel├й Mystic. Ce nom mтАЩattirait. JтАЩavais aussi d├йcouvert une ville homonyme aux   o├╣ il y avait, dans un mus├йe, une salle d├йdi├йe ├а Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les co├пncidences pour ├йcrire.

JтАЩimaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange ├а douze c├┤t├йs, et cr├йais une num├йrologie intime ├а moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons ├а fa├зade victorienne je pensais ├а la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, ├а tous ces immigrants ayant laiss├й leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais quтАЩen mтАЩaventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphr├йmagog, je penserais aussi aux d├йserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam.

67	For the 12th straight year, the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? WhatтАЩs the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). ItтАЩs a world unto itself, with Vancouver Island surf breaks, culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal, and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And, letтАЩs face it, clich├йs of Mounties and hockey aside, Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. ItтАЩs a great time to correct that, as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and youтАЩll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. тАЬTravel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place,тАЭ said Maureen Towey, the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. тАЬWe ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle, a   balloon or a ski lift, we say yes every time. тАЭ On a computer, youтАЩll also notice a stunning drone video, shot in Tofino, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. тАЬAfter many wet days, there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better,тАЭ said Josh Haner, a staff photographer who shot the footage. тАЬAs my droneтАЩs batteries were running out, I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. тАЭ And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors, many of whom live overseas or roam the globe, for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First, why now? That is, why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London, Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting, they didnтАЩt make this yearтАЩs list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting, in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didnтАЩt make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are, of course, just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. WeтАЩd love to hear your suggestions  тАФ   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours.
68	Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festivalтАЩs 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  тАФ   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  тАФ   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, itтАЩs all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the worldтАЩs top jazz players such as Manu Katch├й, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Op├йra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside BasilтАЩs Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Sch├╢nbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of ViennaтАЩs Sch├╢nbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably тАЬAida,тАЭ in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ┬бViva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with тАЬAnother Brick in the Wall,тАЭ on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the cityтАЩs 375th anniversary and is based on Pink FloydтАЩs 1979 album тАЬThe Wall. The bandтАЩs chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Op├йra de Montr├йal on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be.
69	Whether by train, ship or   trail, transit alternatives are poised to proliferate in 2017. Midyear, the Brightline express train in South Florida is expected to open, linking Miami and West Palm Beach. When itтАЩs finished in 2019, travelers can make the trip between Miami and Orlando in three hours, while driving takes four. The terminus at the new downtown MiamiCentral station will include a food hall known as Central Fare. In Switzerland, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the worldтАЩs longest and deepest railway passage, ceremonially opened last June, but officially opened in December. Eventually the   tunnel through the Alps will cut 45 minutes off the trip between Zurich and Lugano. Offering more leisurely tours, the luxury sleeper train Belmond Andean Explorer will begin in May, linking Cusco, in the Peruvian Andes, to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. The itinerary takes two nights, but the company, which also operates the   Belmond Hiram Bingham trains to Machu Picchu, will offer   trips between Cusco and Lake Titicaca. Japan welcomed its newest   train, Hokkaido Shinkansen, last March, traveling between Tokyo and the northern Hokkaido island in just over four hours. This spring, the   Train Suite   will offer   luxury tours in sleeper cars that will travel from Tokyo to the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions. Among 2017 cruise ship launches in the mega class, the   MSC Meraviglia from EuropeтАЩs MSC Cruises, coming in the summer to the Mediterranean, will be among the largest at sea, with a   dome featuring light shows in the central promenade, a   bowling alley and entertainment by Cirque du Soleil. In November, the line will introduce another large ship, the   MSC Seaside, sailing   between Miami and the Caribbean. In March, Celebrity Cruises plans to add two small ships to its fleet, both sailing in the Gal├бpagos Islands. The   Celebrity Xperience will offer trips lasting from seven to 13 nights, providing snorkeling gear, wet suits and binoculars to guests. A smaller craft, the Celebrity Xploration, will accommodate 16 guests. Lindblad Expeditions will introduce its first newly built ship, the   National Geographic Quest, in June in the Inside Passage of Alaska, with kayaks, paddle boards and landing craft for ventures into the wild. The   sailing ships of Star Clippers only look retro. The lineтАЩs newly built Flying Clipper, making its debut late in 2017, will be powered by 32 sails, and it can carry 300 passengers. The   luxury line Silversea will add the   Silver Muse in April in the Mediterranean. Highlights include larger and connecting suites for friends and family, and eight restaurants, including French, Japanese and one that encourages diners to cook for themselves on heated lava stones. Among river launches, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection will begin the       Joie de Vivre in France in March. Crystal River Cruises will unveil the Crystal Bach on the Danube in June and the Crystal Mahler on the Rhine in August. Both will accommodate 106 guests and include butler service, five restaurants and lounges and a spa. Crystal has also announced it will start Crystal AirCruise in 2017: private jet trips aboard its   Boeing  . The inaugural trip ($159, 000 a person) circumnavigates the globe over 27 days, beginning Aug. 31, via Peninsula Hotels. Canada aims to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its confederation by completing its transcontinental Great Trail, a   or roughly   multiuse recreational trail linking Newfoundland in the east to British Columbia in the west, with northern spurs to the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.
70	Broadway shows often fold their tents at the end of the year, fearing the winter blues at the box office. But this year a few shows of note are holding on, at least for a week or two. YouтАЩve got a few more days to catch Stephen KaramтАЩs gorgeous тАЬThe Humans,тАЭ last seasonтАЩs Tony winner for best play (ending on Jan. 15) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical тАЬFalsettosтАЭ (ending on Sunday). Looking further ahead, here are other notable shows and events IтАЩd put at the top of my    list. The first of the majestic   cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson, this drama set in the 1970s (and written in 1979) was, until now, the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway. A classic Wilson ensemble drama, about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben   who has both appeared in and directed WilsonтАЩs plays  тАФ   notably the superb recent revival of тАЬThe Piano LessonтАЭ from the Signature Theater. (In previews for a Jan. 19 opening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.) Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing. But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett, I will grant an exception. And, of course, Ms. Blanchett, who graces this new adaptation of тАЬPlatonov,тАЭ an early Chekhov play, is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut. During the past decade she has made regular, acclaimed appearances on the New York stage, in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company (as is this one). An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns  тАФ   lives full of regret, stomachs bloated with vodka  тАФ   the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton, Ms. BlanchettтАЩs husband. The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov. (In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater.) I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the   blues. The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy, with a glorious, multihued score by Burton Lane and E. Y. Harburg, a dozen years ago, with Melissa Errico as the ing├йnue, Sharon (she who wonders тАЬHow Are Things in Glocca Morra? тАЭ). The seemingly ageless Ms. Errico, I am delighted to report, is unfurling her silvery soprano once again in this revival, directed by the companyтАЩs artistic director, Charlotte Moore. (Through Jan. 29 at the Irish Repertory Theater.) [Read the review] This is not a single show (as downtown theatergoers will, of course, know) but a whole feast of international theater, presented by the Public Theater at its home base and elsewhere. Along with P. S. 122тАЩs Coil and other festivals, it has come to make January a dizzying smorgasbord of experimental theater. Highlights this year include a new production from one of my favorite companies, the imaginative 600 Highwaymen, presenting тАЬThe Fever,тАЭ which is said to be тАЬperformed in complete collaboration with the audience. тАЭ Bring your tap shoes  тАФ   or at least a willingness to blast your way through the fourth wall on a regular basis. (Various locations,  .) Martin McDonaghтАЩs     was the first of his trilogy of plays set in the impoverished Irish village of the title. It returns in a   production from the Druid Theater, the company that first made a splash internationally with a pungent production that ultimately moved to Broadway. Once again the companyтАЩs longtime chief, Garry Hynes, directs. And Marie Mullen, who won a Tony Award as the embittered daughter of a manipulative terror of a mother, with the aptly monstrous name Mag, now takes on that formidable role. (Begins performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Jan. 11.)
71	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway, he wants to rebuild New York CityтАЩs other airport, John F. Kennedy International. Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $10 billion modernizing KennedyтАЩs terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport. He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from. тАЬThe next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia isnтАЩt enough,тАЭ Mr. Cuomo said, speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York, a business group, in Manhattan. тАЬWe need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia. тАЭ In promoting big infrastructure projects, including the Second Avenue subway, which opened Sunday, Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York, and perhaps raising his national profile. The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia and J. F. K. The authorityтАЩs commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $30 billion   spending plan that includes only about $1 billion for improvements at J. F. K. When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority. But the authorityтАЩs chairman, John J. Degnan, did not see the panelтАЩs final report until Tuesday. тАЬWe await an opportunity to review the details of the governorтАЩs proposal,тАЭ Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday. тАЬWe will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority, both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee. тАЭ Mr. Degnan, an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, over the authorityтАЩs spending priorities. The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport. Mr. Cuomo pushed for $2. 5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports, possibly including an AirTrain link from New York CityтАЩs subway system to La Guardia. Mr. CuomoтАЩs advisory panel suggested that most of the rest of the money  тАФ   up to $7 billion  тАФ   could come from private sources, including airlines that use J. F. K. Kennedy is a collection of   terminals, some of which were built, at least in part, by the airlines that occupy them. JetBlue Airways and the authority split the cost of building Terminal 5, which opened in 2008. Delta Air Lines has spent more than $1 billion in the recent years to improve its facilities at Terminals 2 and 4. At La Guardia, the authority has committed $600 million to the rebuilding of Terminals C and D against an estimated cost of about $4 billion. That investment would come on top of a $4 billion rebuilding of the Central Terminal Building there, which began last year. Mr. Cuomo hopes to entice airlines to make similar investments at J. F. K. to compete for customers. He challenged airlines to make offers, saying Delta had called him at 5:45 a. m. on Wednesday. Mr. Cuomo did not mention seeking federal financing.   Donald J. Trump has said he plans to make an ambitious investment in infrastructure a priority of his administration. As part of Mr. CuomoтАЩs plan for J. F. K. Matthew Driscoll, New York StateтАЩs transportation commissioner, said his agency would spend as much as $2 billion to improve the flow of traffic to and from the airport. The changes would include adding a lane to the Van Wyck Expressway and widening ramps at the busy interchange in Kew Gardens, Queens, which Mr. Driscoll said handles 250, 000 vehicles per day. Thomas F. Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that transit agencies would explore creating a   ride between Manhattan and J. F. K. Travelers must now switch to the AirTrain from the subway or Long Island Rail Road, a transfer that Mr. Prendergast described as тАЬschlepping with your luggage. тАЭ Though New York City owns the land under J. F. K. no one from City Hall attended Mr. CuomoтАЩs speech. тАЬInvestments in New York CityтАЩs airports are vitally important to our regionтАЩs   development,тАЭ said Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. тАЬWe look forward to hearing more details about the plans for J. F. K. in the months to come. тАЭ
72	On the morning of May 18, 2014, Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox. It was Election Day to choose the leadership of MexicoтАЩs   Partido Acci├│n Nacional, or PAN, and Lagunes, a former federal congresswoman, was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless, at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link, but it seemed to be broken, so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile, she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies, who claimed that they had received emails from LagunesтАЩs account that she did not remember sending. Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 oтАЩclock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. тАЬI did not send you an email,тАЭ he insisted. A consultant with the campaign  тАФ   who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates  тАФ   overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked. In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla  тАФ   a   drive southeast from Mexico City  тАФ   were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by PueblaтАЩs powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of MexicoтАЩs rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to MexicoтАЩs president, Enrique Pe├▒a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and NietoтАЩs centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno ValleтАЩs opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state  тАФ   including members of his own party  тАФ   under control. тАЬIn the beginning, the governor was   and respectful,тАЭ Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. тАЬWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats. тАЭ This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for MexicoтАЩs presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governorтАЩs office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, MaderoтАЩs campaign manager said that CorderoтАЩs side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. тАЬTheir strategy is clear from the outset,тАЭ he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. тАЬтАЩu2009тАШIf I win, good. If not, I was cheated. тАЩтАЩu2009тАЭ After LagunesтАЩs call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed тАЬthe bunker. тАЭ All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassersтАЩ names and phone numbers  тАФ   widely circulated by email within the campaign  тАФ   and begun to intimidate them. тАЬThe day before,тАЭ the consultant told me, the field network was тАЬmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt. тАЭ According to another worker on CorderoтАЩs campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: тАЬWe know who you are. If you donтАЩt want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity. тАЭ The worker added: тАЬItтАЩs an authoritarian regime. тАЭ Madero won the election, with 57 percent of the 162, 792 votes cast over all. In Puebla, his margin was substantially larger, roughly 74 percent. CorderoтАЩs team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies, leaked documents seemed to show, had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team  тАФ   just one of many private companies that, largely below public notice, have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world, these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage. On average, an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day, a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a   record of our    lives, rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details, stored in a perpetual archive, accessible from anywhere on earth and protected, in some cases, by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes, her email login represented a point of vulnerability, a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment  тАФ   specifically, whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later, John Podesta, chairman of Hillary ClintonтАЩs campaign, was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaignтАЩs technology experts. тАЬThis is a legitimate email,тАЭ he replied, in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate. тАЬThe gmail one is REAL,тАЭ the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide. And so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as тАЬspear phishing. тАЭ It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices,   bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts  тАФ   Twitter, Facebook, Amazon  тАФ   and even access to company servers and internet domains. The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 тАЬClimategateтАЭ incident, which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers, began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files, which American officials attributed to the North Korean government, began with a series of   emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into SonyтАЩs servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults, their quashed dissents, their   plans, their smarmy flattery, all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked тАЬsend. тАЭ In an earlier era, the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior, like bribery or burglary. Now, in many cases, all they had to do was send along a link. The White House, C. I. A. and F. B. I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of PodestaтАЩs email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A   website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling   ethical malware, including   Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a   pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. тАЬThe technology is morally neutral,тАЭ says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. тАЬThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah   to keep track of whomever they donтАЩt like. тАЭ Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R. C. S. can be licensed for as little as $200, 000 a year  тАФ   well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a targetтАЩs computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N. S. A. тАЩs   programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R. C. S. acquires it at the source, right off a targetтАЩs device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a    . The United States government is almost certainly the worldтАЩs most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal   agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F. B. I. beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F. B. I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700, 000 the D. E. A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia. Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the worldтАЩs most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United   state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the   relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F. S. B. one of RussiaтАЩs main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451, 000 euros to license the Remote Control System. Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit тАЬgross   abusesтАЭ and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking TeamтАЩs founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. тАЬWe sell to official, governmental LEAsтАЭ  тАФ     agencies  тАФ   тАЬand security agencies ONLY,тАЭ Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. тАЬIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,тАЭ one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. тАЬHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor. тАЭ When asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it тАЬdoes not comment on confidential business dealings. тАЭ Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because тАЬthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regimeтАЭ and Sudan тАЬbecause of concerns about the countryтАЩs ability to use the system in accordance with the H. T. contract. тАЭ) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client. Until recently, most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile, operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when, in July 2015, an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking TeamтАЩs Twitter feed. тАЬSince we have nothing to hide,тАЭ it read, тАЬweтАЩre publishing all our emails, files and source code. тАЭ Then came another tweet, with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge, 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking TeamтАЩs internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the companyтАЩs contracts, payroll documents, invoices, legal memos,   records and a   cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down. Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling тАЬthe evilest technology on earth. тАЭ You could browse Hacking TeamтАЩs source code, including one line using тАЬbomb_blueprints. pdfтАЭ as a placeholder for files that might be found on a targetтАЩs device. On Reddit, an online peanut gallery formed around the   online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords  тАФ   HTPassword! P4ssword, Passw0rd. But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking TeamтАЩs client list and the names of some of the clientsтАЩ targets. In South Korea, newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking TeamтАЩs software had helped the nationтАЩs intelligence service rig an election after the leak, one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador, a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R. C. S. Three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of Quito all four were members of the opposition party. With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former   anchor, he exudes   credibility. тАЬIf you disagree with someone on the internet,тАЭ he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, тАЬthereтАЩs no need to have a   debate. Just go destroy them. тАЭ A couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking TeamтАЩs headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the companyтАЩs software were Rabe Philippe Vinci, a company vice president and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the targetтАЩs computer: images from   cameras, sound from   mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called тАЬline of eventsтАЭ and тАЬline of actions,тАЭ assembled the information into chronological order. Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or тАЬbad guy,тАЭ turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania. There are three methods, Scarafile explained, for getting the Remote Control System onto a targetтАЩs device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R. C. S. in over a   network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment  тАФ   usually a file from a   program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method, one described by Hacking TeamтАЩs critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R. C. S. through a more elaborate process called тАЬnetwork injection,тАЭ which is said to involve pinpointing the targetтАЩs exact location on the internet, observing the person as he orders up, say, a YouTube cat video, and then serving up a doctored version of the same page, one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground  тАФ   YouTube logo and all  тАФ   as the R. C. S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates. Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an тАЬagent,тАЭ then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking TeamтАЩs product to spy on him. For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as тАЬa bit of social engineering. тАЭ Using the customerтАЩs computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the targetтАЩs computer and   on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. тАЬFrom now on,тАЭ he said, тАЬthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System. тАЭ It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out. On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named тАЬJimmy Page . .. head of the terrorist cell. тАЭ Using Jimmy PageтАЩs Dell, Scarafile logged into PageтАЩs Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused PageтАЩs criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from PageтАЩs phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to тАЬkill David Vincenzetti. тАЭ R. C. S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work. тАЬI donтАЩt like the words тАШinjectтАЩ and тАШinfect,тАЩтАЩu2009тАЭ Vinci, the vice president, said. тАЬR. C. S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?тАЭ Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was тАЬa fighter,тАЭ and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk  тАФ   a sort of mood board, like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. VincenzettiтАЩs mood board, though, wasnтАЩt about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power, which he seemed to envision as one big conflict, a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week, and a quote from another entrepreneur that тАЬbusiness is war. тАЭ On the bad side, Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension, the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea, a line of terrestrial pawns advancing ChinaтАЩs sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran, depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent   deal. тАЬI think the Iran deal is just terrible,тАЭ Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, тАЬOh, itтАЩs such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful. тАЭ тАЬThat is not an official company position,тАЭ Rabe interjected. Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type  тАФ   a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small,   eyes can make him seem sleepily blas├й. On the morning we met at Hacking TeamтАЩs offices, he wore jeans, a   cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water. тАЬIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?тАЭ he asked. тАЬThere is a door, and there are two windows. тАЭ He pressed his hands against the glass panes. тАЬThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,тАЭ he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. тАЬIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively. тАЭ In the   VincenzettiтАЩs parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a   clone, a Tron   game and a   adventure game. As a   student at the University of Milan in the тАЩ90s, he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the universityтАЩs internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when тАЬeverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker. тАЭ Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other   criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with   vendors, part of an emerging arms race over   encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking TeamтАЩs first   client, signed on in 2008. The companyтАЩs Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring. By then, Hacking Team had entered a growth phase, its business driven in part by demand among   governments for   surveillance tools. According to two former employees, the company held talks with Col. Muammar  тАЩs chief security officer, who wanted to build a countrywide   scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred, and added: тАЬThe company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell. тАЭ) The United Nations, which prohibits the export of тАЬelectronic weaponryтАЭ to Sudan, has investigated Hacking TeamтАЩs activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R. C. S. to track Giulio Regeni, a    Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking TeamтАЩs software has not been connected to the case, but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy, the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking TeamтАЩs global export license, so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe, he called the dead student тАЬthis Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt. тАЭ He cited Hacking TeamтАЩs official policy  тАФ   the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. тАЬThere is no evidence that Hacking TeamтАЩs software had anything to do with RegeniтАЩs demise,тАЭ Rabe said.) All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and   groups, looking for тАЬobjective evidence or credible concernsтАЭ that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking TeamтАЩs own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with   content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team   members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded тАЬexploit,тАЭ turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers тАЬare not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I donтАЩt think itтАЩs reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,тАЭ i. e. a support technician, тАЬwould have seen these files and known what was going on. . .. I think thatтАЩs a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident. тАЭ Hacking TeamтАЩs most persistent critic is Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of TorontoтАЩs Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak, Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an   journalist in Alexandria, Va. Ronald Deibert, Citizen LabтАЩs director, told me that Hacking Team тАЬis a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products. тАЭ When I asked Vincenzetti about this, he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money, noting that the group won a   grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking TeamтАЩs sales to Ethiopia. тАЬTheir identity,тАЭ he said, тАЬis: тАШI am the defender of free speech, I am the defender of liberty and democracy.тАЩ O. K. So am I. So is every rational guy. тАЭ If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil, he said, it would be fighting China and Iran. Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online, they were being pored over by R3D, a Mexico     group. Luis Fernando Garc├нa, R3DтАЩs director, says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Pe├▒a NietoтАЩs presidency, and he took notice when Citizen Lab, in 2014, released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time, but now R3DтАЩs team recognized that this could be their chance to find out. Shortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government  тАФ   that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast  тАФ   had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutorтАЩs office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small   collective there. The siteтАЩs name translates to тАЬB Side,тАЭ as in the back of a hit single  тАФ   symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold. Lado BтАЩs editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that PueblaтАЩs government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno ValleтАЩs six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple тАЬsecurity arches,тАЭ   structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and   and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the   website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a   request about them, the governmentтАЩs form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno ValleтАЩs administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic   of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victimsтАЩ laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians. As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking TeamтАЩs other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account  тАФ   soporteuiamx@gmail. com  тАФ   that also appears in many of Hacking TeamтАЩs internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a clientтАЩs request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor. Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. тАЬBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,тАЭ Aroche told me. тАЬNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors. тАЭ More than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from PueblaтАЩs colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado BтАЩs presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which ArocheтАЩs reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. тАЬThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,тАЭ Aroche said. тАЬIтАЩm sorry if theyтАЩre a little bit stained  тАФ   I dropped some coffee on them. тАЭ (Sym Servicios Integrales says it тАЬnever sold H. T. technology to the state of Puebla. тАЭ) In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that тАЬno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company тАШHacking Team. тАЩтАЩu2009тАЭ The government declined to respond further to a list of questions. But a former official from Moreno ValleтАЩs administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the   unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415, 000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year. Some of the R. C. S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. тАЬPeople would come and go,тАЭ one woman said. тАЬThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left. тАЭ Another neighbor said that he often saw a   car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving  тАФ   a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training. Mexico is Hacking TeamтАЩs biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (тАЬThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,тАЭ Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. тАЬI canтАЩt confirm it. тАЭ) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayorтАЩs office. Katitza Rodr├нguez,   director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. тАЬThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,тАЭ she said. тАЬThey are not only listening they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all. тАЭ The Hacked Team files indicate that in   Hacking Team opened an American subsidiary and leased office space in Reston, Va. a   drive from the C. I. A. тАЩs headquarters. The company drew up a тАЬU. S. action plan,тАЭ calling for a significant North American expansion, with new hires and rounds of pitches to the Department of Justice, the United States military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hacking Team was also targeting another potentially lucrative market: American state and local governments. It pitched the R. C. S. to   agencies in San Bernardino, Calif. Washington New York Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. In a risk assessment commissioned by the company, lawyers advised that such sales were probably legal, so long as the product was provided тАЬat a distanceтАЭ from actual investigations and used тАЬin the normal course of government operations. тАЭ American expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives тАЬunlimited power for unlimited hacking. тАЭ In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his тАЬGoing DarkтАЭ speech, the F. B. I. тАЩs director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety  тАФ   enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and   . Instead of тАЬa safe that canтАЩt be cracked,тАЭ Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. тАЬThe law hasnтАЩt kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant   problem,тАЭ Comey said. тАЬWe call it тАШgoing dark. тАЩтАЩu2009тАЭ As the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign   agencies already buy   products from SS8  тАФ   a company backed by the storied   firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers  тАФ   as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used HarrisтАЩs Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F. B. I. which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4, 000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking TeamтАЩs R. C. S. The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the companyтАЩs ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as тАЬgents. тАЭ The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other   allies of law and order. In VincenzettiтАЩs world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about  . 11 intelligence, тАЬblinking redтАЭ: the imploding Middle East a restive,   Russia battalions of   jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and   expertise. Against this backdrop of   danger, concerns about human rights are na├пve at best. VincenzettiтАЩs emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a. k. a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of тАЬa very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled. тАЭ He went on to tap out this sales pitch: The following day, he gave a few more hints: The tone of VincenzettiтАЩs sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare. VincenzettiтАЩs unstated equation  тАФ   privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism  тАФ   is less controversial than it might appear. A supportive echo can be heard in many public statements from American officials, which Vincenzetti often cut and pasted into his mass emails. The former attorney general Eric Holder called for тАЬinvestigative and prosecutorial tools that allow us to be  . тАЭ When Comey warned that тАЬencryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place,тАЭ Vincenzetti forwarded it along approvingly, with the tagline: тАЬWe DO have an answer to many if not all of his concerns. тАЭ And when, in May 2015, Comey warned of a тАЬthreatтАЭ that had тАЬmorphedтАЭ into тАЬa chaotic spider web,тАЭ Vincenzetti sent word to his тАЬgentsтАЭ as well. One month later, an anonymous hack revealed Hacking TeamтАЩs own invisible spider web, and one year later, during the   to Election Day, came the internal emails of the Democratic Party. By then it was clear that tools for digital burglary had spread well beyond the hands of regular police officers. Comey had argued for weaker safes Vincenzetti was selling longer crowbars. They could be used to chase Jimmy Page, arrest Chapo Guzman, fight crime, smear a political opponent or just keep tabs on someone, anyone. To be hidden is to be a terrorist  тАФ   this was the heart of his pitch. Any digital redoubt that could resist being pried open was a public risk and a private opportunity.
73	It hasnтАЩt been a great time to be a man without a job. The jobs that have been disappearing, like machine operator, are predominantly those that men do. The occupations that are growing, like health aide, employ mostly women. One solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides. But while more than a fifth of American men arenтАЩt working, they arenтАЩt running to these new   jobs. Why? They require very different skills, and pay a lot less. TheyтАЩre also seen as womenтАЩs work, which has always been devalued in the American labor market. The two occupations predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers, shrinking 70 percent, and vehicle electronics installers and repairers, down 50 percent. They are 96 percent and 98 percent male. Of the   jobs, many are various types of health aides, which are about 90 percent female. When men take these     jobs, they have more job security and wage growth than in   work, according to recent research. But they are paid less and feel stigmatized. тАЬThe jobs being created are very different than the jobs being eliminated,тАЭ said David Autor, an economist at M. I. T. тАЬIтАЩm not worried about whether there will be jobs. IтАЩm very worried about whether there will be jobs for   adults, especially the males, who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs. тАЭ Take Tracy Dawson, 53, a welder in St. Clair, Mo. He lost several jobs, some because his employers took the work to China and Mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots. He has heard the promises of   jobs in the health care field: His daughter trained to be a medical technician. But he never considered it. тАЬI ainтАЩt gonna be a nurse I donтАЩt have the tolerance for people,тАЭ he said. тАЬI donтАЩt want it to sound bad, but IтАЩve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker. I see it as more of a womanтАЩs touch. тАЭ Also, health aides earn a median wage of $10. 50 an hour. Mr. Dawson used to earn $18 an hour making railroad traction motors. тАЬI was a welder  тАФ   thatтАЩs all I know how to do,тАЭ said Mr. Dawson, who is living on disability insurance because he has rheumatoid arthritis. Women were hit harder than men by the decline in   jobs, according to Mr. Autor. But they have more easily moved into the expanding occupations, and earn more college degrees than men. Women have always entered   fields  тАФ   usually   professional ones  тАФ   more than men enter   ones. There are now many female lawyers, but male nurses are still rare. One reason is that jobs done by women, especially caregiving jobs, have always had lower pay and lower status. Yet when men, especially white men, enter   fields, they are paid more and promoted faster than women, a phenomenon known as the glass escalator. Much of menтАЩs resistance to   jobs is tied up in the culture of masculinity, say people who study the issue. Women are assumed to be empathetic and caring men are supposed to be strong, tough and able to support a family. тАЬTraditional masculinity is standing in the way of   menтАЩs employment, and I think itтАЩs a problem,тАЭ said Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist and public policy professor at Johns Hopkins and author of тАЬLaborтАЩs Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the   Family in America. тАЭ тАЬWe have a cultural lag where our views of masculinity have not caught up to the change in the job market,тАЭ he said. But telling   men to take feminine jobs plays to their anxieties and comes off as condescending, said Joan Williams, a law professor at U. C. Hastings and author of тАЬReshaping the   Debate: Why Men and Class Matter. тАЭ тАЬWhite   menтАЩs wages have plummeted, and what happens to men in that context is anxieties about whether theyтАЩre тАШreal men,тАЩ тАЭ she said. ItтАЩs no surprise, then, that Donald J. Trump appealed to men who feel this way  тАФ   not just his promises to bring back factory jobs, but also his machismo. Many unemployed men who did manual labor say they canтАЩt take the time and make the effort to train for a new career because they have bills to pay. And they say they chose their original careers because they wanted to build things, not take care of people. Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, has a term for this: тАЬretrospective wait unemployment,тАЭ or тАЬlooking for the job you used to have. тАЭ тАЬItтАЩs not a skill mismatch, but an identity mismatch,тАЭ he said. тАЬItтАЩs not that they couldnтАЩt become a health worker, itтАЩs that people have backward views of what their identity is. тАЭ Jon Ray, 31, of Inez, Ky. was an electrician at a coal mine until it was shuttered a year ago. He applied unsuccessfully for maintenance and repair jobs, and got a job in manufacturing after enrolling in a program to learn how to operate computerized tools.   jobs werenтАЩt an option, he said. тАЬI couldnтАЩt afford to go back to school,тАЭ he said. тАЬAnd IтАЩm used to working with my hands. тАЭ If more men do   jobs, they could erase the stigma and turn them into menтАЩs jobs, said Janette Dill, a sociologist at the University of Akron, at least for jobs that require less   caregiving. тАЬMore men will go into care because they donтАЩt have a choice, but theyтАЩre going to carve out spaces for themselves that feel less like womenтАЩs work,тАЭ she said. Ms. Dill was a   of a study published in April that looked at what happens when men move into   jobs in the health care field. Men in the   health jobs, like the nursing assistants who change patientsтАЩ sheets and help them bathe, earned 10 percent less than men in   jobs. But they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time, while   wages were stagnant. Technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician  тАФ   requiring more training but not a college degree  тАФ   paid 22 percent more than other   jobs, after controlling for things like education. They involve less interaction with patients and more with computers, so they are less stereotypically feminine. There is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs, the study found. Black men were 3. 3 times as likely as white men to take the   health jobs, and other minority men were 1. 8 times as likely. White men were more likely to take the   technical jobs. For men without college degrees, more technical training that equips them for those jobs could help. And if health aide jobs paid more and offered better benefits, theyтАЩd probably attract more men. Some hospitals are trying to make caregiving jobs seem manly  тАФ   like with a recruitment poster comparing the тАЬadrenaline rushтАЭ of being an operating room nurse to mountain climbing. Perhaps then men could take the same pride in their work that Mr. Dawson, the unemployed welder, showed when he talked about making pilings for the rebuilt World Trade Center. тАЬI had a good life as a welder,тАЭ he said. тАЬIt always amused me. ThatтАЩs one reason I picked the job. тАЭ
74	Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The TimesтАЩs websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store. тАЬFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,тАЭ Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. тАЬAs a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China. тАЭ Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented. ChinaтАЩs main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions. The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision. тАЬThe request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,тАЭ Ms. Murphy said in a statement. The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulations say apps cannot тАЬengage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. тАЭ The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish тАЬprohibitedтАЭ information. The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the worldтАЩs most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of тАЬharmful informationтАЭ online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable. Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them. AppleтАЩs chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without AppleтАЩтАЩs help and the case was dropped. Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents. тАЬMaybe in the end they have to do it, but I think thereтАЩs something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,тАЭ Ms. Aslam said. тАЬItтАЩs not as simple as, тАШBecause we operate in your jurisdiction, weтАЩll do anything you ask of us. тАЩтАЭ She added that it was тАЬvery worryingтАЭ that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the governmentтАЩs requests. In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the worldтАЩs biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of AppleтАЩs largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed. On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of AppleтАЩs media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting. Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an   internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices. The Times news apps remain available in AppleтАЩs app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China. When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content. But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the governmentтАЩs firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its   app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop. AppleтАЩs decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another regionтАЩs app store. The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspaperтАЩs computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation. Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, AppleтАЩs iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there. Mark Natkin, the   managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could тАЬever fully comprehend how challenging itтАЩs going to be. тАЭ Mr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that тАЬthe technology gap has started to close. тАЭ
75	WASHINGTON  тАФ   Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. TrumpтАЩs election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the FedтАЩs most recent meeting in  . That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates. For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said. тАЬWhile the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline,тАЭ Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. тАЬAny real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy. тАЭ At the December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008, citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year, but the account published on Wednesday  тАФ   after a standard   delay  тАФ   described the final decision as uncontroversial. Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result, the account said, Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election, when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth. тАЬThe job of conducting U. S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months,тАЭ said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, referring to the increased uncertainty. The Fed, led by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress. тАЬParticipants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,тАЭ the minutes said. The FedтАЩs   committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, has 17 members, 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy. The FedтАЩs caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire, and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets. Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus, like a tax cut or a spending increase, could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term, resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly. Instead of acting   the Fed is choosing to wait for more information. But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the FedтАЩs prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases. The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating, seeing тАЬonly a modest riskтАЭ of a тАЬsharp acceleration in prices. тАЭ By holding rates at low levels, the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and   higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. тАЬConsumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month, or even about additional rate increases in 2017,тАЭ said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5, 000 credit card balance. The economic forecast prepared by the FedтАЩs staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. TrumpтАЩs election would result in тАЬslightly higherтАЭ growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be тАЬsubstantially counterbalancedтАЭ by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, which would reduce exports of American goods and services. Several Fed officials reported that Mr. TrumpтАЩs election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. тАЬSome contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policies,тАЭ the minutes said. The minutes also noted, however, that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes. In a recent interview, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said many executives in his district, which encompasses the western United States, worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade, both of which have been important drivers of regional growth. Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers, the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4. 6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus.
76	Rajiv J. Shah, a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, was asked about six months ago to join the committee that would select the foundationтАЩs next president. He said no. Instead, Mr. Shah, who until recently had been the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, ultimately said he wanted to be considered for the post. He got the job. On Thursday, the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the countryтАЩs largest and most influential philanthropies, will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin, who has been president for 12 years. The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving, overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments, companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem. Mr. Shah, 43, will be the first   to lead the Rockefeller Foundation, which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees. Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in todayтАЩs dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross, and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health, creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria, and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world. In recent years, the foundation has focused on the themes of тАЬresilienceтАЭ and тАЬinclusive economies. тАЭ That has resulted in programs aimed at establishing тАЬresilience officersтАЭ in 100 cities to focus on disaster relief and a plan that is sending 100, 000   students to see the musical тАЬHamilton. тАЭ These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants. Much of the foundationтАЩs work concerns improving health and   in Africa, aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change. It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shah worked at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade, rising to be director for agricultural development. From 2009 to 2015, he ran U. S. A. I. D. leading the response to disasters including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. After leaving the agency, he founded Latitude Capital, a private equity firm focused on emerging markets. In those roles, Mr. Shah said, he came to understand the power of   partnerships, a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation. тАЬIтАЩve seen whatтАЩs possible when people come together,тАЭ he said in an interview this week. тАЬWe were able to save tens of thousands, if not millions, of lives. тАЭ Ms. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation, and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015. тАЬHeтАЩs a marvel,тАЭ Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. тАЬHeтАЩs very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years. тАЭ Ms. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U. S. A. I. D. which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments, organizations and companies. тАЬOne of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships,тАЭ Ms. Rodin said. тАЬWe see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this, and has the capacity to be a great partner. тАЭ Richard Parsons, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board, said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates. тАЬRaj is the perfect guy to come in after her,тАЭ Mr. Parsons said in an interview. тАЬHeтАЩs a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now, heтАЩs got a platform. тАЭ Mr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies. тАЬThat core concept of resilience is extraordinarily important going forward,тАЭ he said. тАЬIt gives us the opportunity to evolve into the future. тАЭ But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment. тАЬIt is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago,тАЭ he said. тАЬWe live in a more fractured world. тАЭ The Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. RodinтАЩs tenure, the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundationтАЩs core mission had bipartisan appeal. тАЬItтАЩs widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest,тАЭ Mr. Shah said. тАЬI have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale. тАЭ He will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results.
77	MANILA  тАФ   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao, according to Peter Bungat, the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization, Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao, which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility, the North Cotabato District Jail, were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers, Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates, the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday, when the jailтАЩs power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. тАЬIt was well planned,тАЭ Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any тАЬhigh profileтАЭ inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking, according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie, who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the PhilippinesтАЩ largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization, which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group, Abu Misry, denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no тАЬspecific informationтАЭ as to the identities of the gunmen, тАЬthough speculation is rife. тАЭ Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago, three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail.
